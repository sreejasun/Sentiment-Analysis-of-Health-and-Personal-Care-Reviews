4,12 mg is 12 on the periodic table people! Mg for magnesium,"This review is more to clarify someone else’s review bc they didn’t understand understand the labeling!  It shows 1000mg as advertised & another little label says 12mg bc 12 is on the periodic table for magnesium!  I realize not everyone takes chemistry, but 4 ppl liked his review & so misinformation is spreading.  This works. If however you are on opiate level medications that are causing constipation you should talk to your pain dr or your gastrointestinal dr & ask for a medication called Linzess which works must better & must faster, but is unnecessary for most people.  If magnesium is working for you just make sure to take it with food & drink 6-8 glasses of water per day.  Staying hydrated will really help.  Before switching to Linzess I used to take one 1,000 mg pill am & pm every day with meals & always with an 8 ounce glass of water or other liquid.",[],B07TDSJZMR,B07TDSJZMR,AFKZENTNBQ7A7V7UXW5JJI6UGRYQ,2020-02-06 00:49:35.902,3,True,1,"('NEGATIVE', 0.9783133864402771)",NEGATIVE,0.9783133864402771

The flavor of this chewable probiotic is absolutely amazing. It actually makes me look forward to taking my daily probiotic to help keep my IBS in check. Since taking this, I do feel better and my bloating issues have definitely decrease.

You have to stir it quite a bit and you still seem to have small pieces and residue that doesn't mix in well.  This is the first time I have really tried a ""superfood"".  I tried the green one (vegetable mostly), but am thinking of also trying the red (more fruit, I assume).  For less money, you can probably buy fruits and veggies that will give you the same nutrition, but this may be more concentrated and probably a decent partial substitute for not eating correctly.

5,Gets Rid of Blackheads!,"I am in my late 40's and can't see up close without my reading glasses. I recently purchased a vanity mirror for my bathroom with 5x magnification. I was horrified with what I saw! The wrinkles didn't bother me - that goes along with age. But I have lots of blackheads on my temples! I couldn't see them before. I have used the acne tools - the ones that look like dental tools and they work okay, but those often leave behind temporary redness. And you have to be precise about the location because of the small tips. I found this ultrasonic cordless skin scrubber to be much more effective at getting rid of the blackheads! And it doesn't leave behind any redness! The end of it is about an inch and a half wide and it is able to scrape out the ugly blackheads. You can see the dirt and grime on the tip after you've used it. Gross! Now as far as the scrubber goes, it comes with a charger. Once it is on, it has a vibration thing going on. It heats up a little bit, but not to the point where it is too hot to use or it burns. I just can feel a little heat from it while it is in use. There's a silicone cover to go over the metal end when it is not in use. I am thrilled to have found this!<br /><br />*I received this for free in exchange for my honest &amp; unbiased review.

I once ordered an acrylic organizer geared toward brush storage, but the compartments were so shallow, that my brushes wouldn't stand up in it. I ended up using it for something else instead of storing my brushes. I'm not sure what I will use the smaller well for. It looks like it was designed to hold business cards.

The part that goes behind your head has a velcro fastener with the very cool company name on it. The strap sits low on my neck and is hardly noticeable, even with a shaved head.

(The motor was louder in my second rectangular device than it was in the first.)  The fans run constantly in these air purifiers, but they don’t seem to require a lot of electricity.<br /><br />The air purifier will operate in the up, down, or sideways position, so you don’t need to be concerned about the orientation of your household electrical outlets.  The purifier plug does NOT have a third prong for grounding, though it has wide and narrow prongs like most modern safety plugs.  The purifier covers only one outlet in a two-plug wall outlet, so the second outlet remains available for general use.<br /><br />My first pluggable GermGuardian lasted well beyond the one-year warranty period.  These little air purifiers don’t seem to require maintenance beyond replacing the UV bulb when it burns out (the blue light on the purifier will go out).  The bulbs are easy to replace, but you should NEVER look directly at a plugged-in UV bulb (with the purifier cover open), because this can permanently damage your eyes.",[],B000G2BESO,B08X9LB1WC,AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q,2018-06-18 14:46:24.695,0,False,168,"('NEGATIVE', 0.9958928823471069)",NEGATIVE,0.9958928823471069

4,Mask is excellent but the silk eyeshade is terrible; the mask only is worth the $9.99 price,"The current price of $9.99 for this ensemble is excellent and the mask alone is worth that price. However, if the price were more than $12.99, I would have rated this 2 or 3 stars due to the additional items included.<br /><br />This comes in a giftable box and includes a sleep mask, a silk eyeshade (like another mask), and disposable foam earplugs in a plastic case.<br /><br />I am very impressed with the foam mask. It is a cushiony soft, but full-bodied sleep mask. This mask has eye cutouts. There is also an adjustable strap in the back. Since there is an eye socket channel, I can open my eyes underneath without touching the front of it and it blocks out all light incredibly well. It feels like it is made of cloth covered form. It is comfortable to wear and fits me very well and is not too snug. It does not move around when I lay down with it. Overall, I really love the mask.<br /><br />However, the eye shade feels more like a lightweight silk mask. Even when I extend the adjustable strap all the way, it pulls tight around my eyes, is useless at blocking all light, and is supremely uncomfortable. The ear plugs are also just junk to me. They should leave out both items. I only took off one star because the mask is 5 stars.

3,Lightly padded gorgeous sleep mask; light seeps in through bottom; too tight around eyes; OVERPRICED,"For the current price of $44, I am  disappointed in this sleep mask.

The pleats allow me to expand this until it is relatively snug under my chin and along the sides. The ear elastics fit nicely over my ears. Overall, these are comfortable for me.

1,Small bath bombs with terrible performance & it stains my skin,"[[VIDEOID:491e386908deb8251c574f6eb0c8758f]] There are 12 individually wrapped smal bath bombs in this set. The fragrances are, orange, lavender, frankincense, rosemary, mint, lemongrass, vanilla, seasalt, kiwi, rose, coconut, and papaya.<br /><br />I tried the papaya. When it was first plunged into the water (see video) there was fizz and no suds. Before I could even put the foot bath onto the floor to bathe my feet, the entire bomb fizzed out and dissolved into tang colored water less than 30 seconds later (see photo). Also, the fragrance was hardly detectable even though they smell good in the package.<br /><br />Since I personally do not like the color rings caused by bath bombs in my bath, I used this in a foot bath. The water turned an orange color and that color adhered to my skin and stained my towels but did not stain my foot bath.<br /><br />In summary, these bombs perform terribly, are staining, and are barely fragrant in the bath. The current price of $19.99 is expensive but still competitively priced for this as it comes to $1.67 per bath bomb, which is about what I would expect to pay for bombs of this size. However, at that price, I also expect these to perform and they do not. These are super lackluster and an utter disappointment. I am surprised others rated this 4 or 5 stars. I doubt the other reviewers even tried this in the bath. In the box they look impressive but If they had used at least one, they most likely would not be so impressed.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61SUtFBQ17L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61SUtFBQ17L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61SUtFBQ17L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61WVJBgfbqL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61WVJBgfbqL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61WVJBgfbqL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71aM3YAdfmL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71aM3YAdfmL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71aM3YAdfmL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09FPL7GG8,B09FPL7GG8,AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,2022-05-10 02:31:16.007,1,False,178,"('NEGATIVE', 0.9977399110794067)",NEGATIVE,0.9977399110794067
3,Just as good as plain Epsom Salt; flowers will clog drain if no strainer is used,"At the current price of $15.50 for 20 ounces of bath salts with a pouch of flowers, I do not feel this is worth it. I thought I would like the fragrance but I don't. Also, I have to put a strainer in my sink to prevent the flower buds from going down the drain.<br /><br />I bathed my feet for 20 minutes with about 1/2 cup of bath salts and some of the chamomile flowers.

4,Provides an excellent but very comfortable stretch for neck pain relief but at double the price,"Simple instructions are provided but it is unclear of the correct positioning of the neck without looking at the photos on the Amazon site because the sketch in the instructions does not match the slope of this ""pillow."" Note that I have tried three other varieties of pillows and this is as good as the 5 star one listed below. The only reason I am rating this 4 stars is because the price is double what others charge.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B09KQ3R1J1 one like this for half the price]] - 5 stars<br />[[ASIN:B09F7PH4QR foam one]] - 4 stars<br />[[ASIN:B09G9YKF1H wedge pillow]] - 4 stars<br /><br />For 10 minutes (one can go up to 15 minutes) I just wedged this under my neck with the open wave in the back of my head and let my head fall back. It is super comfortable to use. This actually works for me to help but not eliminate my neck pain.<br /><br />I woke up many months ago with neck pain. After trying everything I could think of, I went to a chiropractor. His adjustments were helping me and he gave me a similar exercise that this helps one perform. He had me roll up a towel, lay on the floor, and then put it under my upper back so that my neck was hanging back.<br /><br />Now I do not have to spend time rolling up a towel. Also, this is firm yet soft enough in the center to be comfortable which is better for alignment. It works great and did not  take any getting used to like the foam device I have. This is a perfect daily exercise for my neck. I just lay on the floor while the back of my neck/head hangs over this. I am able to do this for 10 minutes.<br /><br />In summary, this works for me but the current price of $49.95 is extremely expensive for this.

The four corners can be sealed shut by removing the paper over the adhesive. When I have done that in the past, I find that the adhesive is not strong enough to stick well.<br /><br />The reason I rated these two stars is because the corners that are sealed (not the ones I can seal) come undone as can be seen in my photo. This means I have to glue the corners that are supposed to arrive sealed already.<br /><br />The current price of $12.99 is way too expensive for a box that is coming apart at the seams.

They perform well, produce a lovely rainbow of suds, and dissolve in about 10-15 minutes. The fragrance is subtle in the bath. However, there is one difference in the results (read on).<br /><br />Since I personally do not like the color rings caused by bath bombs in my bath, I use them in a foot bath. When I was done, the color did not adhere to my foot bath but it turned both my feet pink and  my drying towel. Note that the smaller bombs did not do this even though they are the same. Perhaps it is the extra profusion of color in such a large size. This is the only reason I rated this 4 instead of 5 stars.<br /><br />The current cost of $ 19.99 for 3 bombs comes to a very expensive $6.66 per bomb.

4,Scent is subtle but refreshing; bath is soothing; a bit pricey,"[[VIDEOID:bd46da57494d65289f923e4b0523dc95]] These green tea and chamomile bath salts have a lovely but subtle fragrance. I used this in my foot bath and found it soothing. The only difference to me between this and Epsom salt is that this has a fragrance and typical Epsom salts do not. However, some of today's Epsom salts have fragrances but they are not as good as this.<br /><br />The package says to pour 1/4 salt into the bath water but it doesn't say if it is 1/4 of the container or 1/4 cup. Some reviewers used 1/4 cup and others 1/4 of the container. They need to specify this. I used 1/4 cup. The crystals dissolved after about 10 minutes.<br /><br />The current price of $15.99 is pricey for this but then again it is almost like a spa-like experience.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/818gWqyLJgL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/818gWqyLJgL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/818gWqyLJgL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81fJJAaScbL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81fJJAaScbL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81fJJAaScbL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B093Q6DPJW,B093Q6DPJW,AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,2021-08-27 01:34:58.014,1,False,189,"('NEGATIVE', 0.9930996894836426)",NEGATIVE,0.9930996894836426
1,Large color-staining bath bombs; not giftable,"There are 12 individually wrapped bath bombs in this set and they all smell the same to me. The box is wrapped around the center in packaging tape which looks hideous. The bombs themselves, however, are presentation quality in the sense that they are wrapped in tissue paper and then also shrink wrapped in plastic under that.<br /><br />I hardly detected any fragrance with these and they all smell the same to me. Since I personally do not like the color rings caused by bath bombs in my bath, I test them in a foot bath first to either bathe my hands or my feet. Because I was skeptical of these, I bathed my hands.<br /><br />One bath bomb dissolves in about three minutes in close to hot water and the suds last about 10-15 minutes. The fragrance is almost non-existent and the results are horrendous. First of all, as I was filling the foot bath, the color of the bombs sprayed all over my sink and kitchen backsplash just as a result of running water over the bomb. I had about five minutes of cleaning to do from that. However, after bathing my hands, they came out pink as can be seen in the photo and I was unable to wash the color off with soap and water. These are a complete disappointment.<br /><br />I would not recommend these at all only because of the color staining of these bombs, the limited fragrance, and the way the box is wrapped.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71C6SjVWl-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71C6SjVWl-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71C6SjVWl-L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71LPy5F2hdL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71LPy5F2hdL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71LPy5F2hdL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/816y-jTe-GL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/816y-jTe-GL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/816y-jTe-GL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81QCtwOjY5L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81QCtwOjY5L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81QCtwOjY5L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81fX-ky72-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81fX-ky72-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81fX-ky72-L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08VDM2K1T,B08VDM2K1T,AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,2021-08-26 00:40:41.373,1,False,190,"('NEGATIVE', 0.999370276927948)",NEGATIVE,0.999370276927948

5,Exquisitely crafted hefty brush with long handle & great grip,"I tried several brushes over the last several months but this one is the best so far. This is now my favorite brush. The handle looks exquisitely crafted even though it is probably machine made. I also have this brush in the darker color wood that I use in the shower as a back brush with soap and it is great.<br /><br />The brush is hefty and is one solid piece, which is fabulous as the head cannot fall off the handle like some other brushes I tried previously. The handle of this back brush has indentation grips on it which provides me with a good hold. The handle is also long, which provides me with a good reach.<br /><br />The brush head is sturdy enough to be exfoliating and cleaning yet gentle enough not to be irritating. I love that there is a rope at the end for hanging in the shower and there is even a canvas bag for storage after air drying if desired.<br /><br />Overall, I love this as a wet brush for my back. I do not use this for dry brushing. The current price of $21.80 is about twice what most wooden back brushes go for but the quality is also higher but it's cheaper than their darker wood version that sells for $24.86 which is $3.06 more than this lighter colored one.<br /><br />PS The Smiley Smith engraving with what looks like a monkey is cool too.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81UnNF+rTVL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81UnNF+rTVL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81UnNF+rTVL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81YVo91X-rL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81YVo91X-rL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81YVo91X-rL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81wYVW2swsL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81wYVW2swsL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81wYVW2swsL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B094DPW2SM,B094DPW2SM,AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,2021-08-07 20:38:39.207,1,False,192,"('POSITIVE', 0.9995597004890442)",POSITIVE,0.9995597004890442

4,Only works for masks with thin ear elastics; excellent price,"These lanyards are perfect for hanging my masks around my neck but they can only be hooked onto masks that have a very thin elastic due to the tiny clasp on either end. The cord is sufficiently long and can be cinched tighter or looser around the neck if needed. I felt it was roomy enough cinched partway down.<br /><br />The chains are colorful and work well. The current price of $5.99 is excellent for this as it comes to $1.20 per lanyard. I really like fun color of these chains; however, my absolute favorite mask chain is [[ASIN:B08HQZ1D1Z the Luxure Store Chain]], which is more than 12 times the price but is also an eyeglass chain, jewelry, and a mask holder.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81KIpAh1nIL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81KIpAh1nIL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81KIpAh1nIL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81pfN3K6XML._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81pfN3K6XML._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81pfN3K6XML._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08FX2ZV33,B08FX2ZV33,AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,2021-08-03 23:27:46.684,1,False,194,"('POSITIVE', 0.9980261921882629)",POSITIVE,0.9980261921882629
5,Small  & beautiful foot file; hold like a computer mouse,"For the current price of $3.99 this is an excellent foot file. If it were priced higher, I would have rated this 4 stars because it is small. In order to use this, I have to hold this in my right hand like a computer mouse by grasping the outside and placing my forefinger in the center. This works gently but effectively on the dry skin on my heels. If held correctly, this file is relatively easy to hold  and easy to work with. Some files are like cheese graters and this one is gentler. When I am done, I just rinse the business end under warm water and the dead skin that was removed easily rinses off. The file looked brand new afterward.<br /><br />Due to the small size, this is a few dollars cheaper than other etched glass (a.k.a. nano crystal) files on the market, which is great. In addition, this is a gorgeous file in a pretty color.

5,These insoles are absolutely wonderful; arch is high yet there is pliability throughout,"I am always looking for inserts with good arch support to help alleviate pain from plantar fasciitis. Usually I am disappointed in the orthotics on the market. However, this insert is wonderful. It has the right balance of firmness and pliability which makes it feel cushiony without being overly soft or overly hard. It also has a high arch that is very supportive for someone like me who has plantar fasciitis.<br /><br />I take at 9 to 9.5 in shoes and sometimes a 10 depending on the cut. Therefore, I ordered this in that woman's size. I use these in my boot-like slippers and I feel like I am walking on air.<br /><br />The current price of $17.84 ($20.99 minus 15%) is competitively priced for an arch support of this quality and support.

They all smell nice  but the fragrance difference is super subtle. They are made with essential oils.<br /><br />I tried the greenish/bluish/yellow bomb in my foot bath.

My feet also came out feeling  soft. <br /><br />Unfortunately, there was a slight adherence of the green color of the bomb to my ankles and heels but it was ever so slight. A white bathtub might develop a slight ring of color around it from these bombs but I suspect it would immediately wash off. Insofar as ""performance,"" these bombs are really good. <br /><br />Luckily I had a strainer in my sink because I had no idea there was a surprise miniature animal figurine in these. I had a little dinosaur in mine. <br /><br />Although no price is listed, I suspect these will be priced between $16.99 and 18.99.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81-eA7Nf6WL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81-eA7Nf6WL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81-eA7Nf6WL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81-vgNfCzJL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81-vgNfCzJL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81-vgNfCzJL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81GEN+ER1WL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81GEN+ER1WL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81GEN+ER1WL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81QHSdztlYL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81QHSdztlYL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81QHSdztlYL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81h9yWFDvaL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81h9yWFDvaL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81h9yWFDvaL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81pGMRkGWPL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81pGMRkGWPL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81pGMRkGWPL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81wmB8kCsmL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81wmB8kCsmL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81wmB8kCsmL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B093BQLHXT,B093BQLHXT,AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,2021-06-19 02:28:32.669,1,False,200,"('POSITIVE', 0.7593085765838623)",POSITIVE,0.7593085765838623
4,Lightweight back brush with small brush head and decent length handle,I use a back brush every day. This body brush works well. It has a small brush head that is of medium softness so it is mildly exfoliating. The handle is long enough for me to reach my back comfortably.

3,Purse-like carry case for 2x’s per day weekly dosing; PU leather case pretty; cell removal difficult,"I love the portability of the individual days of this ""pill case attache."" It is great for 2x's per day doses. However, I have a few dislikes.<br /><br />LOVES<br /><br />- Each day is portable.<br /><br />- Each side is large enough to hold about10 pills (as long as they are not super large)<br /><br />- I find it easy to fill<br /><br />- The PU carrying case makes the pill compartments easy to carry.<br /><br /> DISLIKES:<br /><br />- The pill cases are tightly enclosed in the case making it a bit difficult to remove each day.<br /><br />- There is no AM PM written on each cell; instead there is a moon and sun.<br /><br />- The days written on the side of the case are only one one side. Since the cells move around in the case, the day of the week is not always visible.<br /><br />In summary, even though this is large, I like that each circular day container can be taken in a purse for one day and there is no need to take the entire container. They also hold a sufficient amount of pills for me. Unfortunately my dislikes have me rating this case 3 stars. The current price of $10.99 is reasonable for this and a lot cheaper than the same case in black that is $5 more by another vendor.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81X6kx-GM1L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81X6kx-GM1L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81X6kx-GM1L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ncmIWaqNL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ncmIWaqNL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ncmIWaqNL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/912OZfEAiVL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/912OZfEAiVL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/912OZfEAiVL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08ZYFQWNK,B08ZYFQWNK,AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,2021-05-11 00:04:45.121,1,False,202,"('NEGATIVE', 0.9525633454322815)",NEGATIVE,0.9525633454322815
4,"Perfect for cookies, cupcakes, and classy gifts; the interlocking bottom is a cinch to set","There are 30 shiny gold boxes that are perfect for Christmas gifts, cookies, cupcakes, or other classy but lightweight gifts. They come in one piece and unfold easily into a reasonably-sized box. The bottom is interlocking and just unfolds easily into place. <br /><br />Each box should be able to fit about one to two pounds of cookies depending on the size of the cookie. I can even get an appropriately-sized tiny cake in this box. Overall, I think these are classy and well-made but they are thinner than I expected. Therefore, these are for lightweight items only. Also, I would recommend using tissue paper or foil on the bottom before using to carry treats to stabilize the box a bit.

4,Large & fragrant bath bombs; I love that the color did not adhere to my skin,"[[VIDEOID:592997822369b48eed3e38e4fedf4269]] There are 6 individually wrapped bath bombs in this set in the scents listed below.<br /><br />- Romance - La Vie en Rose<br />- Optimism - Orange Juice<br />- Happiness - Lemon Tree<br />- Confidence - Grapefruit Punch<br />- Acuity - Chocolate Mint<br />- Tranquility - Purple Lavender<br /><br />Each fragrance is divine, smells fresh, and all the scents are different but they are only subtly different. These bombs are made with essential oils and they are large. Since I personally do not like the color rings caused by bath bombs in my bath, I use them in a foot bath. One bath bomb dissolves in about five minutes in close to hot water. The fragrance is wonderful and the results are skin softening. I also love that the color did not adhere to my skin or to my foot bath; at least the color of the ""Romance"" bomb I tried did not adhere.<br /><br />The current price of $17.99 comes to $3 per bath bomb which is just a tad pricey but then again I feel these are better than most.

3,"Plug-in w/timer/nightlight/24 sounds (fan, white noise, nature); controls hard to see","[[VIDEOID:4783b505348a419e1d8bcbb2086e9d4c]] This sound machine comes with a total of 24 sounds. It is packaged with an A/C adapter, the unit itself, a cheat sheet circle, and a regular instruction pamphlet.<br /><br />Operation is simple as per my video. I just plugged it in and then pressed the light button for my choice of nightlight color. I also pressed the sound playing button to start playing the sounds. This button serves as the on/off button for the unit. The nightlight feature has seven lights that can be cycled through with two variations of white light. The timer feature goes from 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes or can be turned off to play continuously. There are three sound controls - nature/lullaby, white noise, and fan. There are 8 available sounds each for the white noise and fan and 16 nature sounds. I particularly like the nature sounds.<br /><br />The current price of $25.99  is what machines like this go for. Of course, in the days of smart home speakers such as Google Home, no such device is really needed as I can just ask my Google Home to play sounds or tell it goodnight to get a routine. Nevertheless, for those who want a sound machine for a baby room or just for themselves, this does work. Know that there will never be more than 24 sounds available and unless one loves all the sounds, only a few of them will ever be played.<br /><br />I rated this unit three stars for several reasons. First, I prefer a battery operated unit (correction to what I said in my video). I do not like the idea that I have to be tethered to a power supply to operate this and want to be able to take it with me anywhere. Second, the controls on top are very difficult to see (see photo). The printing needs to be a bright white so that it is visible to the operator. Third, the unit is not as sleek as some other units I tried previously--it's tall and squat. Nevertheless, this works as designed and it is a good machine, but this is not my top pick.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81FOSLqFxdL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81FOSLqFxdL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81FOSLqFxdL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91bnNNepwAL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91bnNNepwAL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91bnNNepwAL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08YYCL7Z9,B08YYCL7Z9,AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,2021-04-17 22:20:44.865,2,False,205,"('NEGATIVE', 0.9962259531021118)",NEGATIVE,0.9962259531021118
5,300 everlasting DRY cloths; promotes waste unless used repeatedly to clean - SEE UPDATE,"I misunderstood what these were. I thought they were pre-moistened disposable wipes. However, these are DRY wipes that have to be wet. They are very strong and remind me of an everlasting paper towel. The problem is that I use paper towels or wet wipes to clean that are more disposable and can be thrown away after the initial use. I feel bad throwing these away and am not too keen on rinsing out litter pan gravel, lots of dust, and floor debris down the drain in order to reuse these.<br /><br />As can be seen in my photos, I used this to clean up litter pan dust. For this test, I did rinse it out and reused it again. I actually felt guilty throwing away the one wipe I used because it really is not very disposable.<br /><br />Obviously these have a purpose in situations where one wants to use a wipe like a rag that gets reused over and over again. For those purposes, these are perfect. However, I have an aversion to rinsing dust, debris, and grease down the drain and prefer to use paper towels instead. Therefore, I might re-purpose these to wash my dishes instead of using the cloth Handi Wipes.<br /><br />I was thinking these might work in a kennel but who wants to wash the wipe and re-use it after picking up animal waste and stuff. <br /><br />Currently there is no price listed but I suspect these will be costly.<br /><br />UPDATE - I've been using these for six months now and each wipe lasts me two weeks. It will take me forever to use all 300. I use them to clean my sink and wipe down my countertops several times per day. As as a result, I raised my ranking from 3 to 5 stars simply because they last very long.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712biawhJBL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712biawhJBL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712biawhJBL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71eHpYYazKL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71eHpYYazKL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71eHpYYazKL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81LbGFsv+7L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81LbGFsv+7L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81LbGFsv+7L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81v0+POew9L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81v0+POew9L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81v0+POew9L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08KGTL2QG,B08KGTL2QG,AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,2021-04-09 01:44:46.902,1,False,206,"('NEGATIVE', 0.9982860684394836)",NEGATIVE,0.9982860684394836

Nevertheless, these mitts have the best of two worlds. The mesh is thin and sewn onto the glove. The glove has two finger holes for the thumb depending on which side is being used. If I want a sudsy wash, I pull this on like a glove and use the mesh side. If I want to exfoliate, I turn it over and use the rough side.

3,Fragrances are not long-lasting but the citrus glow is wonderful,"There are three roll-on fragrances in this set of Real Love, Citrus Glow, and Frankincense. I love the Citrus Glow as it has a full-bodied orange aroma. The Frankincense is my next favorite, followed by Real Love which is my least favorite. I cannot describe the scents of the other two.<br /><br />I applied each to the inside of my wrists. Unfortunately, the fragrance does not last long at all (about one hour).

5,This is excellent at smoothing cracked heels,"This is an excellent set for smoothing calluses or cracked heels. It comes with the rechargeable wand, a USB cable, three pumice heads, a cleaning brush, two foot masks, and two toe separators. I do not care for the toe separators because they hurt and are thick. However, everything else is great. Per the Amazon site, the grinding heads are coarse, regular, and fine.<br /><br />There are two speeds (slow and fast) and a tiny light on the front. The power level is also displayed during use. Operation is super simple. Just make sure the desired grinding head is fully seated and then press the ON/OFF button. Press again if the fastest speed is desired. Press a third time to turn off.<br /><br />I did find the grinding a bit ticklish but was able to get through it. This is definitely a keeper.

3,Excellent mask w/filter but the sizing runs small; medium is more like a kid size,"This mask is excellent. It has a nose wire and internal pocket for the supplied filters. The ear loops are adjustable with the silicone adjuster; however, they can fall off if adjusted too much. A lanyard would prevent them from falling off.<br /><br />There are two thick filters supplied as well.  The only big negative with this mask is that the medium adult size is more like a kid-size mask. I usually take a medium in a mask as I find the large is too loose. However, with this mask, I should have picked a large.<br /><br />The $19.99 price tag is also too expensive for this. If the sizing were right, it would have gotten 4 stars from me. If both the sizing and price were right (about $10), then it would have received 5 stars.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/8116jfGBKjL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/8116jfGBKjL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/8116jfGBKjL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81FnFJ6ImqL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81FnFJ6ImqL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81FnFJ6ImqL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81RdO5SaBWL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81RdO5SaBWL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81RdO5SaBWL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08LKPZHMM,B08LKPZHMM,AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,2021-02-25 02:27:09.801,1,False,212,"('NEGATIVE', 0.9954535961151123)",NEGATIVE,0.9954535961151123
2,"Battery operated sound machine w/timer, nightlight dots, & 6 annoying sounds","[[VIDEOID:4fb8863b7bacf229caca45924b0227ba]] This is a white noise sound machine with a total of 6 sounds. It ""sits up"" like an alarm clock. I love that it is battery operated. I charged it overnight. This comes with a USB cable (not the typical micro USB; perhaps type C), the unit itself, and an instruction pamphlet. <br /><br />Operation is simple as per my video. Press and hold the on/off button for about three seconds to turn the unit on or off.  <br /><br />Rotate the dial on the front to move through the six sounds of brook, thunder, white noise, wave, wind, and bonfire. All but one sound is pure annoying noise.<br /><br />The timer can be set from 20 to 120 minutes. Each press turns on a light in the front of the unit and when the lights are off, it means the timer is off.<br /><br />There is a nightlight feature that only works when powered on. The nightlight button is in the center top. There are three light varieties that can be cycled through with each press and the 4th press will turn off the light.  The first press turns on a light dot that rotates around the dial. The second press turns on one side of dots, then turns off the top dot and turns on the next bottom dot until it cycles around the dial with half the dots on and half off. The next press keeps all the dots lit. This is what they call breathing lights.<br /><br />The volume buttons are on the right side top that can be used to increase or decrease volume.<br /><br />The current price of $16.19 ($26.99 minus 40%) would be extremely reasonable for this if I liked it but I do not. It has a limited musical repertoire that is more annoying noise than anything else and the nightlight feature is more of a series of indicator lights. I like the look of this and that it is battery operated. I also like the simple operation. However, the two most important features (nightlight and sound) are lackluster in my opinion.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81tgvIIlhbL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81tgvIIlhbL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81tgvIIlhbL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08THJD1MH,B08THJD1MH,AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,2021-02-23 22:49:52.719,1,False,213,"('NEGATIVE', 0.9983879327774048)",NEGATIVE,0.9983879327774048
4,"Good, hefty brush but short handle; massaging side not useful to me","I tried several brushes over the last several months and love the KOZIS Wooden Bath Brush (Amazon item # B08HR2GBHC) the best. However, this one is very good too.<br /><br />The brush head side is ample for good coverage. The bristles are of medium softness. The massaging side is not useful to me because I have no desire to use that. In fact, I do not even understand why anyone would use that. <br /><br />The brush is hefty and is one solid piece, which is fabulous as the head cannot fall off the handle like some other brushes I tried previously. It also has a rope loop to hang up in the shower. In addition, a self-stick hook is supplied if needed but I did not use it.<br /><br />Besides the massaging brush head that I find useless, the only negative to me is that the brush handle is about two inches shorter than I would like. Many brushes have a longer handle and a longer handle is best when trying to reach my back. Nevertheless, this is still very functional and it is very well made.<br /><br />Overall, I like this brush even though it comes in second to the KOZIS I love. The current price of $11.99 is about right for a two-sided wooden brush.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/812Ee2XwitL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/812Ee2XwitL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/812Ee2XwitL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81f6GghEENL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81f6GghEENL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81f6GghEENL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08L6J4YT1,B08L6J4YT1,AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,2021-02-04 22:31:43.945,0,False,214,"('POSITIVE', 0.9975858926773071)",POSITIVE,0.9975858926773071
3,Handle too short and rope in the middle of the puff is annoying - 2.5 stars,"This brush is two-sided. The only thing I like is that the bristles on the brush are relatively soft on the back. However, I would have preferred a larger head so that there are more bristles and larger puff.<br /><br />The other thing that annoys me is that the handle is too short and I have to stretch to reach my entire back. In addition, the rope loop in the middle of the brush is ridiculous and annoying during washing. Why they thought this was a good thing to attach to the puff is beyond me. There is already a hole in the handle for hanging.<br /><br />A self-adhesive hook is provided for hanging although I did not use that.<br /><br />In summary, this is functional but is the least favorite back washer I tried so far. Also, the current price of $14.99 is outrageous for this.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81-NXCbd94L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81-NXCbd94L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81-NXCbd94L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/812R0p+VuqL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/812R0p+VuqL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/812R0p+VuqL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/816sRUx4UML._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/816sRUx4UML._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/816sRUx4UML._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81wb2Kl3DxL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81wb2Kl3DxL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81wb2Kl3DxL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08NQ2Q2DY,B08NQ2Q2DY,AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,2021-02-03 18:39:40.675,0,False,215,"('NEGATIVE', 0.9984301924705505)",NEGATIVE,0.9984301924705505

It is not battery operated and comes with a USB cable but no A/C adapter, the unit itself, a round instruction card, and a regular instruction pamphlet.<br /><br />The unit must be plugged in to operate.  Operation is simple as per my video. There is a nightlight feature where several lights can be cycled through. The timer feature goes from 15 to 120 minutes or can be turned off to play continuously by holding the button down. The play button will turn the unit sound on or off. There are three sound controls - nature, white noise, and lullaby. There are six available sounds for the first two and only four lullaby sounds.<br /><br />The current price of $23.99 is reasonable for this. Of course, in the days of smart home speakers such as Google Home, no such device is really needed as I can just ask my Google Home to play sounds or tell it goodnight to get a routine. Nevertheless, for those who want a sound machine for a baby room or just for themselves, this does work. Know that there will never be more than 16 sounds available and it always has to be plugged in to operate.<br /><br />PS - I was almost going to lower the rating of this unit by one star because there was a card insert with the unit saying that $10 will be provided for a positive review. Such unethical practices annoy me. This unit is good enough to stand on its own merits without having to buy a review and if it were not, then it would not deserve a positive review.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/812zqwtPe3L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/812zqwtPe3L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/812zqwtPe3L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08QS17KZR,B08QS17KZR,AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,2021-01-20 23:58:59.673,1,False,216,"('NEGATIVE', 0.6953234076499939)",NEGATIVE,0.6953234076499939
3,Large & fragrant bath bombs; BEWARE color adheres; my skin & nails turned a SMURF BLUE,"I love the Heeta brand as I have a detangling brush of theirs that is excellent. Therefore, when I saw these I just had to try them. There are 12 individually wrapped bath bombs in this set in the scents listed below. <br /><br />- lavender<br />- orange<br />- lemon<br />- strawberry<br />- peppermint<br />- coconut<br />- vanilla<br />- grapefruit<br />- ocean<br />- rose<br />- blueberry<br />- mango  <br /><br />Each fragrance is divine and smells fresh and exactly the way it should smell. These bombs are made with essential oils and they are large. Since I personally do not like the color rings caused by bath bombs in my bath, I use them in a foot bath. One bath bomb dissolves in about ten minutes in hot water. The fragrance is wonderful and the results are skin softening. BUT.....I used the rose bath bomb and the final color of the water was an indigo blue which turned my heels and toenails a SMURF BLUE. I also had a blue ring around my ankle. The skin color dissipated during drying but the nail color stayed for several showers. The blue coloring was easy to rinse off the foot bath.<br /><br />The current price of $32.99 comes to $2.75 per bath bomb which is just a tad pricey but then again I feel these are better than others I tried previously. This would make a wonderful gift as long as one does not mind the color changes particularly to the nails. I really love them but only for a foot bath.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71rnyFOEPwL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71rnyFOEPwL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71rnyFOEPwL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/815jOKjYxqL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/815jOKjYxqL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/815jOKjYxqL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/815kI0Q5EPL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/815kI0Q5EPL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/815kI0Q5EPL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81WBuDrULEL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81WBuDrULEL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81WBuDrULEL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Y1msGHOiL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Y1msGHOiL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Y1msGHOiL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81rKJqwQ5WL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81rKJqwQ5WL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81rKJqwQ5WL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08CKKLXHD,B08CKKLXHD,AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,2021-01-11 00:59:13.174,1,False,217,"('POSITIVE', 0.9879146814346313)",POSITIVE,0.9879146814346313

Therefore, I consider these 5-star gift bags at a 2-star price.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-yivD5tWL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-yivD5tWL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-yivD5tWL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/810IIuGuMML._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/810IIuGuMML._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/810IIuGuMML._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/814aU5G54uL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/814aU5G54uL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/814aU5G54uL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/819MKkPiWEL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/819MKkPiWEL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/819MKkPiWEL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81xzwjDz1NL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81xzwjDz1NL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81xzwjDz1NL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08F2D5BYT,B08F2D5BYT,AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,2020-12-24 14:04:48.891,0,False,220,"('POSITIVE', 0.7230322957038879)",POSITIVE,0.7230322957038879
4,Nice buff puff set but back brush is shorter than I prefer,"This is a very nice shower set. I love buff puffs over loofahs any day. To me this is not a loofah set but a puff set. What I like about these is that they lather the soap very well.  The handle on the back wand has a nice grip but it is only 10 inches long from where the wood goes into the puff. My other back brush has a 15-inch handle. I still can use this but it is not as easy a reach. This is the only reason I took off one star.<br /><br />In addition to the body and back puffs, a stick-on hook is included. Note that the white/black plastic should be peeled from the hook to reveal the silver finish. I did not use the hook because I already have hooks in my shower. However, this addition is also a nice touch.<br /><br />Overall, I really like this set. I would consider this 5 stars if they made the handle longer on the back puff.  The current price of $9.89 ($10.99 minus 10%) is very reasonable for this set. I also love the variegated black and white colors of the mesh.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81YhNFn5h2L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81YhNFn5h2L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81YhNFn5h2L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08K7GSZLL,B08K7GSZLL,AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,2020-12-20 04:25:49.813,1,False,221,"('POSITIVE', 0.9916757345199585)",POSITIVE,0.9916757345199585

2,"Sizing is all wrong; even if it were right, it is not worth the $50 price tag","I take a size 9 to 9.5 women's shoe and that is the size I ordered (see photo). However, the sizing advertised is all wrong. This is more like a size 11.5 if measuring from tip to tip. Also, I just noticed that they claim a smaller woman's size equals a larger men's size. That is incorrect. A size 9 in a women's would fit a size 7.5 in a men's size and not vice versa as the men's sizing is always 1.5 lower than the female sizing. These cannot be cut down so I can't use them.<br /><br />If these fit, they do have some cushioning and arch support, which is good. However, it is made of super cheap foam and there is no way this is worth the $49.95 price ($24.95 if applying the $25 discount) they are asking. I would not expect this to sell for more than $6.<br /><br />NOTE that I tried to attach the sizing listed on the Amazon site and point to the wrong sizing but Amazon would not post that review, so I removed that photo.

1,Style 1056 provides full coverage but design is so annoying to me that I hate it,"I ordered the pleated light blue mask known as design 1056. The cloth is very comfortable and once I wrestle with the cord and get everything situated, it does provide full coverage of my face with the cloth extending far back under my chin but I have to make sure I guide the elastics behind my ear. If I do not do this, the mask will not stay on. It is also a very large mask. I do not like the behind the head adjustable cord because it keeps tangling in my hair and also keeps coming loose. As long as the mask does not move, coverage is complete and the material is soft and breathable. I also like how I can pull the mask down and it just hangs around my neck until I need it again. The big negative is the cinch cord and the constant adjustment. The cord also gets crooked and is not always even and I have to keep picking it out of my hair.<br /><br />The current price of $6.99 would be expensive but competitive if this worked well.

The silicone loop can be used to loop it through something like a carabiner, etc.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81LRSabxryL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81LRSabxryL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81LRSabxryL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81do7AT1YTL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81do7AT1YTL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81do7AT1YTL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B089T6CX4R,B089T6CX4R,AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,2020-09-01 21:24:51.471,0,False,234,"('POSITIVE', 0.6048147082328796)",POSITIVE,0.6048147082328796
3,Interlocking box design is difficult to work with but it is still good for small goodies or gifts,"There are 30 shimmery champagne gold boxes and 6 pages of 20 clear stickers (totaling 120 stickers) that come with this set. They come in one piece and fold into a mid-sized box.<br /><br />I finally figured out how to fold the box bottom correctly. The tabbed flaps go on the outside of the bottom and interlock into the other flaps. They are not very sturdy, so I suspect that 4 of the 120 stickers should be used to secure the 4 tabs as shown in one of my photos.<br /><br />As long as one seals the bottom, it should hold. These are perfect for Christmas gifts (no wrapping needed) or for cookies, cupcakes, or other classy gifts.  Each box should be able to fit about one pound of cookies depending on the size of the cookie or four regular-sized cupcakes. Overall, I think these are classy but I do not like the interlocking design of the bottom that requires stickers to provide hold.<br /><br />The current price of $18.99 for 30 comes to  $.63 cents each which is reasonable","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41MVJFYE9kL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41MVJFYE9kL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41MVJFYE9kL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Qc3vJV2bL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Qc3vJV2bL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Qc3vJV2bL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71kZuWqF-kL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71kZuWqF-kL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71kZuWqF-kL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81AqrjmJKrL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81AqrjmJKrL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81AqrjmJKrL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B087RGYQNJ,B087RGYQNJ,AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,2020-08-18 22:01:53.603,0,False,235,"('NEGATIVE', 0.9936975836753845)",NEGATIVE,0.9936975836753845
5,"Excellent unscented heating/cooling wraps for neck, arms, shoulders, legs, etc.","My boyfriend and I are highly impressed with this set. There are two pretty lilac heating and cooling wraps. We heated them in the microwave for two minutes each one. They come out really warm and are soothing as a neck wrap, to lay over the shoulder, around the arm, or leg.  These can also be used cold by putting them in a waterproof plastic bag in the refrigerator for at least four hours to chill. We personally only use these for heat therapy.<br /><br />There is Velcro along one end to keep the wrap in place. One has to be careful not to let the Velcro touch any delicate clothing because it is strong and can damage delicate fabrics like sweaters. The wraps are unscented and made of clay beads and millet. As a result of the ingredients, they are heavy. These wraps cannot be washed; they can only be surfaced cleaned.<br /><br />The current price of $22.99 for these two wraps is very reasonable. We are both highly impressed.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710K-mM8HTL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710K-mM8HTL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710K-mM8HTL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81fNSLtsJwL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81fNSLtsJwL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81fNSLtsJwL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B086R23VBS,B086R23VBS,AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,2020-08-16 23:47:55.569,1,False,236,"('POSITIVE', 0.9938739538192749)",POSITIVE,0.9938739538192749

I own other types of sleeves like these that help me with my plantar fasciitis. Nevertheless, he tried these and says they are very, very comfortable. He likes them as ""socks"" but says they do not offer any support or compression. I tried them on and they are too big on me. I got size 13-15 and he takes a 13 shoe, so these were the right size for him.<br /><br />He personally does not understand why they are open toe and neither do I.

3,Pill cutter arrived pre-cracked; pill cases okay but pills are not visible,"I actually ordered this for the pill cutter. Unfortunately, that arrived cracked but it still works. The pill is cut by a razor-like blade in the middle of the plastic cap. The pill has to be balanced on the tray below. Its use is somewhat successful.<br /><br />The two single-day pill boxes open easily and are portable for travel. They do what they are supposed to do, which is hold pills. However, my boyfriend and I wish these were clear so that the pills can be seen. This is the only negative with the cases. Also, the case covers are held on by a thin piece of plastic that will eventually fall off with lots of use.<br /><br />The current price of $9.99 is on the expensive side for this set but still competitive. There are better pill cases on the market.

3,Compression is very light for 20-30mmhg; socks are fun & comfortable but toe box is weird,"There are four colorful compression socks in this package. I wear a 9-10 shoe so I selected the large/x-large size. A compression rating of 20-30mmhg is supposed to be firm and strong; however, the compression is very light. Also, the toe box feels as if it is sewn awkwardly on the sock. It is not uncomfortable, but has to be adjusted just so to feel best.<br /><br />I wore these all day and they look and feel great. These colors are fun and the socks feel almost like regular knee-highs.  Overall I do like them but I took off one star for not feeling like a compression rating of 20-30mmhg and another star for the weird toe box.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71YpU7GtEUL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71YpU7GtEUL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71YpU7GtEUL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81-vePkX-mL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81-vePkX-mL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81-vePkX-mL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B085KVB96V,B085KVB96V,AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,2020-08-01 22:48:29.502,0,False,239,"('NEGATIVE', 0.8744021058082581)",NEGATIVE,0.8744021058082581
5,Perfect arch supports for my plantar fasciitis; love the heart-like design,"I purchased over 20 pairs of these [[ASIN:B01M7VGJNY Dr. Scholl's arch supports]] for my various shoes to reduce my plantar fasciitis pain. They never stick permanently but they work well for me. However, these arch supports look and feel nicer. I particularly love the heart-shaped design. I also tried similar arches [[ASIN:B07YDP8PXS like these]], but now I am liking this better.<br /><br />There are two pairs in this package. It is perfect for a tall arch like mine and they feel very comfortable in my sneakers. They do have an adhesive backing, but I do not expect them to stick forever.

This is a medium/large and runs a bit big.<br /><br />I take a size 9 to 9.5 in a woman's shoe and 7.5 to 8 in a man's boot. I ordered these in a medium / large size which is supposed to be for that size foot. However, they are way too big in the foot area as the heel comes halfway up my ankle. They do fit around the calves nicely, however.<br /><br />I love that they offer medium compression (15-20 mmHg) around my calves and some compression on the soles of the feet and arches. I felt comfortable in them all day without feeling like the life was being squeezed out of my legs. I also like the ""normal sock"" look of these knee-highs and they wash well in the washer but I lay them flat to dry. The blue hearts are very attractive even though the off-white is a bit dingy looking. I consider these socks very stylish.

On the left side of the book, these are located on the left. However, on the right side they are located on the right.  I would expect the date to always be on the left, no matter whether it is an odd or even page.

3,No side effects but no impact either for me; might work for you,"My boyfriend swears by tart cherries in any form.  I've read a lot about them and sour cherry reduces inflammation and muscle soreness, helps with insomnia, and prevents gout (a form of arthritis).  Inflammation is my middle name so I wanted to try this. Although, I don't have gout, I do have arthritis in various parts of my body. I also have daily muscle aches and inflammation (which was recently verified by a doctor), yet after consuming these capsules for a couple of weeks, they have had no effect either good or bad on me. I should be finished with the bottle in another two weeks.  The positive is that I did not have any side effects.  I've used Nature's Bounty red yeast rice and although that product worked for me to lower my cholesterol, I had a permanent nasty side effect from it. Therefore, I consider the absence of any bad effects with this supplement a big plus. On the other hand, I've had no reduction in soreness or inflammation so it's like taking a placebo for me.  It does appear this tart cherry concentrate works for some, so I suggest anyone considering this give it a try.<br /><br />Depending on how many pills are taken per day, this bottle provides a 60, 30, or 20 day supply. The recommended dosage is 1 to 3 pills per day with meals. The max I've taken was 2 per day.<br /><br />I called Nature's Bounty to understand why the bottle says 1000mg equivalent on the front, yet the back says 250mg per capsule. What the fellow say to me was that the powder is concentrated and the 250 is the weight if you were to empty the contents of the capsule. However, he said since it is an extract, these compressed components are equivalent to 1000mg per capsule. Whether this is really true or not, I have no idea.<br /><br />As for the ingredients, besides the tart cherry (prunus cerasus) fruit extract, each capsule also includes vegetable cellulose and less than 2% of silica and vegetable magnesium stearate.

4,Solid air purifier.. love the Cube!!,"Love the Cube design.. perfect for those who want to use in a small space. An air purifier with a white noise output! Device itself creates a white noise that actually can be soothing and will not interrupt sleep or conversation.<br /><br />I appreciate this comes ready to use… And includes an extra filter. *One concern I do have- is there is no listing for replacement filters to purchase at this time..!!! The concern is if it’s necessary to replace this item prior to being available online? And second issue.. what will these cost! This matters for me to make a claim this is value worthy to a buyer. As you can see- these questions can affect whether this purchase holds true value: if/when/how much replacement filters will be.. and it’s my reason for detecting x1 star.<br /><br />As for functionality.. this seems very easy and straightforward. This contains solid and helpful instructions that include diagrams as well as real time photos- see pic.’s I included. It also includes a small screwdriver which is needed to open cover at given time- very helpful to be all inclusive. *hack: keep instruction manual, extra filter included and tool all in one place.. this will simplify the filter swap when needed!<br /><br />Buttons are white with gray writing and have indicator light when selected.. but, for any with less than stellar eyesight- You may need to navigate choices under regular light source.. at least till you’ve become familiar with button placement. Otherwise, it can be hard to see. Not a deal breaker just a factor to consider.. who will be end user and could this pose an issue?  Once you selected a  function.. this works as expected and does a fantastic job. It allows varied speeds and set timing options- it even notifies when filter must be replaced… lets just hope it’s available! Hoping this info helps your decision- stay safe.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51DY1x0ZCFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51DY1x0ZCFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51DY1x0ZCFL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61YfJOU+V4L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61YfJOU+V4L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61YfJOU+V4L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Ma3dnwhsL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Ma3dnwhsL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Ma3dnwhsL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71xabLoVM0L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71xabLoVM0L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71xabLoVM0L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09CPW99M8,B09CPW99M8,AEIPJBAN7A55Q5DFFPZSR2UV3OKA,2021-12-12 05:02:27.147,0,False,255,"('POSITIVE', 0.9837657809257507)",POSITIVE,0.9837657809257507

It is soft and it does have secure Velcro (at least for now.)  I like the color and it is not completely unflattering when she wears it.  But I find it a little lacking in quality of materials and details.  The Velcro looks visually uncomfortable and I'm not a big fan of the way the elastic bunches the fabric, nor is the fabric particularly plush.<br /><br />She sees lots of potential as a swimming and bath wrap and would probably give it five stars and I would give it three so I split the difference.  Personally I would just like something that exudes a little more quality, but I will not doubt the utility.

5,Cool Gadget,"I watch lots of skincare videos. I often see gadgets like this one used. It's a much easier way of deep cleaning pores and doing extractions.

5,Better than a Plastic Scraper,"I have spent years making homemade bread for my family and one of my most important tools has been a plastic dough scraper I got from a King Arthur seminar several years ago. Without explanation, my scraper simply disappeared without a trace and no one knows what happened to it (I think it got tossed in the trash by accident). I went about finding a replacement and after looking at a number of products I chose this one based on the price and the positive reviews. It has proven to be a good tool, a little different than my old scraper but still fine for my needs.<br /><br />Instead of plastic, this one is stainless steel encased in silicone. There are a couple of important factors here. First, because of the silicone shell the scraping edge is soft and pliable. This is helpful for scraping around crevices and getting as much dough from a round plastic bowl as possible.  Because of the stainless steel inside, the whole is stiff though still slightly bendable which allows it to flex just enough to clean the bowl of my stand mixer without fatigue or permanently getting warped or bent. It is stiffer than my old plastic scraper, and while this is a positive thing it does require getting used to it.<br /><br />Unlike my old plastic scraper, this one will work on a hot saucepan. That’s good news for when I am making candy and don’t want to wait for the syrup to cool and harden, requiring a lot more effort to remove. I did not find any statement regarding the temperature limit for this scraper but based on other silicone utensils I have it is probably safe up to around 400 degrees F.<br /><br />And...silicone is more non-stick than plastic so clean-up is a little easier. It was never bad with with my plastic scraper, but it did require a bit more effort than this new scraper just because of the nature of the materials of each.<br /><br />I’m very pleased with this scraper. It meets the need I had and it is better than my old plastic scraper that I used for years. It works well, it can be used on hot or cold cookware and it is very easy to clean. It’s reasonably priced too. Based on my experience, this is a very easy product to recommend.",[],B07QH9NDN4,B07QH9NDN4,AFLX66DKF6R3H6OEOC3TIVAYXZIQ,2019-09-14 13:43:34.648,2,True,338,"('POSITIVE', 0.9813084006309509)",POSITIVE,0.9813084006309509
5,Excellent Support,"Anyone involved in sports has the potential of suffering a strain or injury to the knee, especially if the sport requires running or repetitive motion. Having injured a knee in the past I know how unpleasant this is and how long it takes to recover. I didn’t have a sleeve like this when I was recovering but I wish I did.<br /><br />This knee sleeve is made of a stretchy material that provides enough stretch to fit comfortably but still remain snug; that is, it does not cut off circulation while is stays in place. It does not pinch or cause irritation behind the knee when the knee is bent either which is nice. The whole is very breathable though it still gets a little warm when worn (to be fair, I am writing this at the onset of summer – everything is warm).<br /><br />The main feature of this sleeve is the silicone buttress that supports and semi-immobilizes the kneecap. It is a round insert (insert in the sense that it is sewn in, not removable) that provides two things for the knee: it keeps the knee cap from floating (a residual problem I still have from years ago) and it provides some cushioning that assists a bit with minor impacts. The cushioning is nice, but keeping the kneecap in place is very helpful as it keeps it from sliding and pinching the muscle.<br /><br />While this sleeve does slightly restrict movement is does not really interfere with most activities. It is comfortable/breathable, it provides good protection for the knee and it keeps things in place so the knee can heal faster. Overall I am very pleased with it and wish I had this years ago.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

4,Pretty Patterns but the Edges Aren’t Perfectly Smooth on This One,"I do love the color variations present throughout this carved piece of natural jade, but it does have an uneven notch/blemish present along the longest edge that obviously resulted from a tool mark mistakenly made during the grinding process. This scraper does have an unshiny, matte finish (it is not super glossy like some other gua sha tools I’ve used), so it might be more preferred by those searching for a natural looking accessory, and it seems comfortably sized and shaped overall.<br /><br />It does come with an attractive drawstring storage bag with a leafy botanical design, so that is a nice bonus, I just wish every edge of this scraper had been smoothly shaped and polished. But that’s the only critique I have for this one. It’s great for increasing circulation and lymphatic drainage and for increasing the absorption of various face serums!

The air is scented strongly for up to about 3 feet above each bomb, and they dissolve cleanly without staining surfaces, so I’d still recommend this boxed dozen to others!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81BzzvncIDL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81BzzvncIDL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81BzzvncIDL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Fw-DquQeL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Fw-DquQeL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Fw-DquQeL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B097D11WWB,B097D11WWB,AFTLUVGQWKW6XSQ5TB6UER5Q263A,2021-10-11 22:40:30.201,0,False,356,"('POSITIVE', 0.999677300453186)",POSITIVE,0.999677300453186
3,Differing Jade Shades and A Noisy Rolling Issue 🪀,"I’ll start by saying that the pair of jade facial tools I received do indeed match the online product photos. The gua sha scraper is a significantly darker shade of green than the lighter bright green hue of the accompanying roller. I’m not sure why anyone would intentionally choose a set of paired tools that differ so drastically in color, but at least they’ve been accurately represented in the listing.<br /><br />While the scraper is smoothly polished and comfortable to use and hold, the dual-ended roller is rather noisy. Unlike most other jade rollers currently available, this roller doesn’t have the clear silicone plugs present inside each drilled cylinder, so all rolling motions produce a clunking sound as the stones bump up against the metal bars of the triangle-shaped hardware. The stones are nicely polished and attractive otherwise, and each end of the roller still provides adequate pressure, but the overall functionality leaves a little to be desired since a silent rolling mechanism hasn’t been ensured.<br /><br />At a current list price of $4.95, this is by far the cheapest jade facial set I’ve come across, so it might be great for new users who are looking to test drive a pair of these tools before possibly selecting a slightly more expensive version, but the visual impact of the widely different color shades is definitely distracting.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81PLUZJb6qL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81PLUZJb6qL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81PLUZJb6qL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B096RJR692,B096RJR692,AFTLUVGQWKW6XSQ5TB6UER5Q263A,2021-09-27 21:33:09.806,1,False,357,"('NEGATIVE', 0.9971729516983032)",NEGATIVE,0.9971729516983032
5,Sip Sip Hooray! 🍷🌿,"The antioxidant-rich solution contained in these squeeze pouches is packaged and produced in Canada. The directions say it should be stored in a dry, dark place at room temperature, and the flavor tastes like tart grape juice. 🍇 The ingredients do list the presence of a couple of preservative compounds, but I like that there are no artificial flavors or added sugars, and the box comes stamped with a clearly marked expiration date.<br /><br />There are only 10 calories present per serving, but the recommended usage schedule advises consumers to take one sachet twice daily. At $20 per box, it would cost customers $120 a month to consume this resveratrol supplement regularly (because 10 pouches would disappear every 5 days). Since the overall price and perceived value of any item is subjective, the purchase likelihood will vary from person to person, but the potential payoff is exponentially beneficial.<br /><br />If this super fruit solution can combat free radical damage enough to slow or reverse aging, then I’m in! Since it does also contain goji, blueberry, pomegranate, cranberry, açaí, and green tea extracts, I at least feel like I’m consuming a myriad of healthy juices in the process! I’m pleased with the brand and the easy-to-open packaging overall, but I’d probably rather have a single container of the liquid substance rather than multiple single-use pouches.

5,Love Everything About This!,"KAIRNE's reusable bamboo cotton rounds  make up remover + metal storage container is such an awesome product and at a ridiculously low price!  The metal container comes in 3 colors: black, blue and green. I have the black and its so pretty.  2 separate lids are included, one goes directly over the cotton pads, the other is for the container itself.  16 bamboo cotton rounds fit in the container . The cotton material is 70% bamboo cotton, 30% regular cotton.  You might think the number of rounds is low. It is not.  They're reusable , durable and hold up incredibly well.  One  bamboo round is equivalent to 100 disposable (regular) cotton pads.  The 16 bamboo rounds are going to last a VERY long time!  Also included (and I find this so  neat and unique!) is a 100% cotton laundry bag. Simply place the dirty  bamboo rounds in the laundry bag, add it to a load of laundry and you've got 16 freshly washed bamboo cotton rounds! How neat is that? You can also hand wash  them as well. (KAIRNE recommends washing the rounds prior to the first use and I did so )<br /><br />The only makeup I wear is eyeliner. I use the bamboo rounds to remove it and to apply toner.  Boy, are they ever soft and do such a great job!<br /><br />I have dry, sensitive skin and have no allergic reaction of any kind with these rounds.<br /><br />I've been using compressed mini facial sponges for my makeup removal/toner application regimen.  I do like the sponges but I far prefer KAIRNE's reusable bamboo rounds and will be using them only  from  now on. I definitely recommend this product.

5,You're Going to Love What These Poufs Do For Your Skin!,"I love what EvridWear has done here!  3 pouf balls, each with a different exfoliating level: white (light), blue (moderate), dark blue (heavy).  You get to try each pouf  all and choose your favorite. ! I love the white pouf, my husband likes the dark blue.  The variety isn't the only awesome detail.  These poufs are VERY well  made. They're incredibly  strong and durable, with  tight bonding that ensures the pouf won't quickly stretch out or fall apart.  Each does a great job washing /exfoliating skin (all skin types!)  and produce a nice lather with soap or body wash.  I have terribly dry, sensitive skin and these poufs do not irritate or scratch my skin in any way.  All 3 are comfortable to use.  They even have small rope so the pouf can be hung up when not in use. The colors are nice as well.  I love the plastic zipper bag the poufs come in.  It serves as an excellent storage bag to hold the poufs until they're used. I was seriously shocked at the price. For as high quality and well made as these poufs are, I would have expected them to cost far more!  There's a pouf for everyone's preference.

4,Finally...I Slept Like A Baby!,"I've had insomnia for 2+ decades.  Its bad enough when it happens at home but it always happens while on vacation in a hotel, even when I'm in a room far from elevators, snack machines, etc.<br /><br />Last week we went to Atlantic City for a few days.  I was lucky enough to get a room away from both the elevators and snack/ice machines but I knew that wouldn't be enough.  I took a silk sleep mask and the pair of earplugs that came with the masks along and hoped for the best.<br /><br />On the first night, I was exhausted from driving and walking around all day/night, yet I couldn't sleep. Then I remembered I had packed the mask and ear plugs so I climbed out of bed and got them from my bag.  Boy, did the mask make it nice and dark!  The earplugs blessedly gave me total silence as well! I did not fall asleep immediately, but sleep DID come and that RARELY happens for me on vacation.  I usually spend the first one or two nights wide awake. What a nice surprise to actually be able to get a few hours of sleep.<br /><br />The mask darkened the room tremendously. Even the next morning when I woke up to a sunny, bright and cloudless day the room was still dark for me thanks to the mask.  The mask was nice and soft and the mask itself was comfortable. The band that went around my head was very tight and took a bit for me to get used to.  The earplugs did a glorious job of drowning out my husband's horrific snoring.  On the second night, I was able to fall asleep fairly quickly and stayed asleep through the night, thanks to the mask that kept the light out of the room and the earplugs which, by the way, are very comfortable and flexible and soft , that kept the horrific snoring sounds as well as the maid's cart noises from the hallway silent!<br /><br />SO glad I had the mask and earplugs with me. I was actually able to sleep while on vacation and rest and relax thanks to them~",[],B07RD9YLG8,B07RD9YLG8,AGAM2CCKV52HI4YZU7ASZTSXA7YQ,2019-07-10 22:06:28.709,0,False,385,"('POSITIVE', 0.9637949466705322)",POSITIVE,0.9637949466705322

Think of a volcano erupting. The lava running out the top.and down the sides. The same happens if the case is too full.<br /><br />So when you unscrew the case you have essentially coated those fingers in poroxide. And if your like me, those same fingers are used to insert your contacts. So you sre basically putting poroxide onto your contact and into your eye.<br /><br />Make sure to discard the solution in the case as soon as you have removed your contacts.

3,"Vegan and Good Fiber Content, but Doesn't Add Much Sweetness","Cutting back on sugar is a good idea. But some food and drinks simply do not taste good if they are completely sugar free. You need something to add at least a little bit of sweetness to the overall taste without resorting to artificial sweeteners. A product made for the task at hand is Super Organics Agave Inulin Powder.<br /><br />Starting with the nutrition, each four- gram serving of Super Organics Agave Inulin Powder contains three grams of fiber, so this is certainly a plus.  There are 15 calories per serving, which is more than other artificial sweeteners, but still low. The product is vegan and gluten free, too.  I don’t expect much from a nutritional standpoint with any type of sweetener, so this product does rank highly, with the fiber content being its greatest asset.<br /><br />With its other qualities, Super Organics Agave Inulin Powder produces mixed results. It is similar to powdered sugar with its texture. It does tend to clump a little, so if you want it to dissolve with minimum effort you need to sprinkle a small amount into your drink. I didn’t have any problem dissolving it in a cup of hot coffee, but the main problem I had with this is that it doesn’t add much sweetness to your drink. It takes several spoonfuls to make a noticeable difference and if you use this much, the product isn’t going to last long. It is priced somewhat high, too, making the cost per serving a little on the steep side if you use the required amount needed to produce any significant level of sweetness.<br /><br />I encourage anyone to cut back on sugar and if adding an alternative sweetener to your favorite drink will help you achieve your sugar- reduction goal, then Super Organics Agave Inulin Powder is a viable means to achieving said goal. But if you truly want to achieve a sweet taste, then this product is going to fall short because it takes too much of it to reach the required level of sweetness. I usually drink my coffee and tea sugar free, so even a small amount of sweetness works for me. But this product will not be enough for other people, so I am going to give it an average rating overall.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51PFK-lRwSL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51PFK-lRwSL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51PFK-lRwSL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07VVDCH76,B07XVVVB8W,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2019-10-28 01:44:25.776,0,False,467,"('NEGATIVE', 0.9880565404891968)",NEGATIVE,0.9880565404891968

1,"This is a Joke, Right?","I accept we need to wear masks in public. That's fine, I don't mind. I have some breathing issues (COPD) but I don't run around with fake notes from fake government sites trying to get away with not wearing a mask.<br />These seemed like a good idea for five or ten minutes then someone took a closer look. Other styles of these inserts have clips or hooks molded into them so they can easily be attached to the disposable paper style of mask. These inserts lack any means to hold them in place. You're expected to stuff this under your mask and wish or hope it stays in place. It won't, it's going to slide around while your mask goes another way. If you're lucky it won't pop out and fall to the ground.<br />Breathing while wearing a mask isn't fun. You can do it. Doctor's do it with much more restrictive masks for half a day or longer. but this insert. . . you're literally blocking off 50+% of the surface area inside the mask with plastic that blocks air flow. I sat quietly for five minutes trying this mask out, it became uncomfortably warm inside the mask. I started to sweat. When I tried to talk the insert slid about under my mask. I had to take this off. It was horrible.

There's no slot for a filter and it's only two ply and worse even though the ear straps stretch fairly well there's not enough elastic and they pull painfully at my ears. You can see in the image how it's pulling my ears forward. I wish this had fit better because I like the design, it looks like an old bandanna and I wore a lot of those camping and hiking.

5,Highly accurate and very attractive design,"My definition of 'attractive' may be disputed, but when I say that this is accurate I mean it. The first thing I did after I unboxed the review sample that I received from the manufacturer was to test just how accurate it it. A few notes: I am not going to regurgitate the product description or specs on this page. I will give my impression and highlights that led me to give this five stars. Also, mine shipped with an included tape measure, which was not mentioned in the description at the time of this review. It's actually a high quality one that has an auto-retract mechanism that adds even more value to this set.<br /><br />I test a lot of scales so I have standard weights that are used for calibration, and in this case comparison. My approach is to use different weights, then repeat the weighing. There was no deviation among the results from all tests.<br /><br />In addition I also performed the same tests using a different scale and received the same results. My conclusion is this is accurate per the product description right out of the box.<br /><br />You can switch among pounds, kilograms and stones by pressing a button on the underside of the scale. Plus this is accurate to one decimal place (in .2 increments), so you can see detailed results if you are battling the pounds (or kilos or stones), as well as weigh objects.<br /><br />A few things that I especially like about this scale are the large display, which is a big deal at my age, and the blue lit background. I also like the fact that it will come alive as soon as I step on it and give me the bad or good news after a few second lag, and will go back to sleep shortly after I step off of it.<br /><br />Among the scales that I have tested this one stands out in ease of use, display quality and accuracy. It's heavy and well made, and the fifteen dollar price tag at the time of this review makes it an incredible bargain. If you could see one in person you'd be as impressed as I am.",[],B00JRF4THY,B00JRF4THY,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2014-06-10 18:25:21.000,70,False,556,"('POSITIVE', 0.9923061728477478)",POSITIVE,0.9923061728477478

4,A little bit of elbow grease goes a long way,"Not sure why people are dissing this.  I only have one stainless steel appliance, a toaster. And with the trouble I had with that toaster looking awful I am very happy I don't have SS appliances. This toaster I was about to get rid of because the streaks on it drove me mad.  It worked fine and looked like heck.  I remember having seen this at Target back when I didn't own any SS item (except pans which BKF takes care of) and when I went looking for it out of desperation it wasn't there.  I have tried all manner of natural cleaners on that darn toaster, KD Gold which I use everywhere, the all purpose Method cleaners and even Windex.<br /><br />I finally found it at Whole Foods.  Initially was unhappy when I sprayed and just gave a quick wipe.

4,Flat Purple seat cusion,Quite an advantage when sitting for a prolonged period on hard surfaces.. Not really &#34;soft&#34; but adds a lot of comfort as your weight seems more distributed and hence the &#34;No-Pressure&#34;.  It is very portable and works on many surfaces.

I have been using 2 different types of the horse-shoe shaped chair cushions (with the sacral cutouts) for about 1 year  and find these to be amazing when sitting for long periods on a wooden chair.. but they are more rigid and do not quite distribute pressure like the purple...

2,Didn't like the texture mix of drink and crunchy.

The powder is tan, and doesn't smell like cookies in any way.<br /><br />What I DIDN'T like about this flavor was the little bits of cookie. I don't know, but<br />I don't want chunks in a liquid drink! A blizzard has chunks of cookies, but you eat those<br />with a spoon. This you drink, so the little cookies chunks are a little weird on the tongue.<br />However, it isn't the worst flavor. I thought there would be more cookie dough flavor, but<br />it is more like melted ice cream with bits of a chocolate chip cookie (not the chip part,<br />but the actual cookie part) mixed in. It adds crunch to the drink.<br /><br />I really did not like having chunks of things that needed to be chewed when I was<br />trying to drink a liquid shake. I would imagine that you could mix this up and freeze it,<br />and have a very healthy and tasty frozen snack, but we have not tried that.<br /><br />Not the worst tasting mix out there, for sure, and it has a nice load of vitamins.<br />The weird texture mix caused it to lose a star, down to only two.

4,"@8 grams per serving. Bovine, Marine, Chicken, Eggshell provides types 1, 2, 3, 5, & 10","It's fine. I have my preferences over this. This is a nice blend of various collagen sources (bovine, marine, poultry, eggshell) and therefore a wider degree of collagen types (1, 2, 3, 5, 10). Hence the elevated price tag (I don't rate on price, but I will comment that it should be compared to others of this ilk. It is with similar price range). Some sources are more expensive. Some sources don't require as much to be effective. Ie, bovine is cheapest, but needs more, marine is usually most expensive yet needs a lot less. This has a good amount, well fair amount, per serving at about 8 grams of collagen peptides (hydrolyzed- meaning it is broken down to readily absorbable, easily digestible form, and it mixes in hot or cold without gelling).<br /><br />Multi forms can impart a slight smell and flavor. I think the ones that use eggshell tend to have a little extra aroma. May disappear depending on what it is being used in. Or might be noticeable. Not a big fan of it in my plain black unsweetened coffee, but is totally fine in a smoothie, or when I have a coffee that I doctor up with cream and flavor syrup. I dont fault the brand, as it is merely a facet of the composition. I will always used collagen, often single source, but will pepper in multi source as I see fit.<br /><br />This is a perfectly fine product.

4,"Mild taste, light chew. On the go snack to ward off hunger, or makes nice addition to sandwich wrap","Pretty good! Helps keep my sanity when I get hungry before my main meal.  I think it makes for a quick snack- either to take care of a sweet tooth need, or just need something to nosh on to take care of hungries before next meal. When I am on the go all day, I often dont eat anything until dinner (Im just not hungry, and copious amounts of coffee and/or a smoothie takes care of my need to masticate a meal), but.. sometimes I do get a little hungry. OK, sometimes a lot. lol.  I pack some snack bars just in case, but sometimes I want a better mouth feel/different texture than what a dry bar provides. SO give me cheese stick, olives, meat stick.. and now these yam sticks. Of all the other options, these are the easiest for me as they are room temperature stable. Now I can have one of these and maybe a handful of nuts, and I am satisfied enough to hold off until dinner.<br /><br />Has a light, mild taste. I think kids would like this as it isnt as strong as some sweet potatoes. I know some of the flavor is dependent on the type of sweet potato/yam used, and region. That is the extent of my expertise, though haha.<br /><br /> The texture is decent. It is a soft with a little bit of chew. Easy to eat. I have another yam product I prefer (about as mild, but little more chew), but I would totally buy these again. If only because I can control myself better. This is 80 calories per stick, where as the other is a bag at 180 per serving/bag. Not bad, but I dont always need that much at once (but I cant control myself haha). So different items purchased for different reasons. If you want to get fancy, this would be delightful paired with a slice of turkey or chicken, then maybe a slice of cheese all rolled in a small soft tortilla shell.

4,"soft, true to size, can be trimmed, good energy return in heel area, so far so good","I have tried these in a few pairs of shoes, all of which range from 10 to 11 womens, so I chose the sizing option of 10-11.5 women (or 8.5-10) men's. The sizing seems spot on. As with many inserts, there is a guideline on the bottom for trimming to size. I did not find these too wide for the shoe. They are the exact same as other inserts I stacked them against. I literally pulled inserts out from other shoes and put these on top. I took a couple of pics side by side, as trying to show the sameness by putting them on top of each other doesn't show anything.. because they are same size! Excused the um, wear and tear on the used inserts ;)<br /><br />The inserts feel pretty good. Not super cushiony, but I do feel a pleasant energizing tingle when I wear them, especially in the heel.

It is super sturdy, and<br />-It it long enough (49"") for me (5'10"") to hold comfortably. If you need it shorter, remove one section (and it will be 38"").<br />-I can really push into the floor without worry of this pole breaking.<br />-Each section screws on. It comes with two cleaning pads.<br />-The bucket it- as pictures- tall and thin. Does not take up much space in terms of storage. I haven't knocked it over yet, but I am aware that it could due to its tall center. It is a nice change from peeling the pads off and rinsing them by hand.<br />-Micro fiber pads are pretty standard. They work the same as any of my others. Just presses on or peels off. Easily interchangeable.<br />-You can access the interior of the bucket (for in depth cleaning and drying of the bucket, if need be) by popping out the handle. Then the rest can pop out. The bucket is surprisingly sturdy as well. It isn't a cheap feeling system at all.<br />-The swivel mop portion is magnetic, so it will store as one long pole. Also makes it easier to use the bucket as you wont have a mop head impeding quick insertion<br /><br />Overall I am impressed. I am most excited for the metal pole. I am not used to using a bucket, don't feel I need one..  but this is neat to have. Again, I have not knocked it over. It seems to be well balanced. It works as described! I have 2 big labs and lots of sandy soil that gets tracked in with them, so floor sweeping, vacuuming, and washing is a regular chore.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/714vJL+jkpL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/714vJL+jkpL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/714vJL+jkpL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71rx4ycfl2L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71rx4ycfl2L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71rx4ycfl2L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0878RRKZ2,B0878RRKZ2,AF2BLE54TEMGZ546U763ZHZRXC4A,2020-09-02 16:42:04.213,0,False,630,"('POSITIVE', 0.9842178821563721)",POSITIVE,0.9842178821563721
4,"not fan of packaging, spout really pours out liquid, but detergent is great","I do not care for the packaging.<br /><br />At first, I thought the cut outs were neat. I like how there is a spot to store the cup, and the access area to the spout is tidy looking.<br /><br />Then it came time to pour product into the cup, and WHOA it comes pouring out. I really need to be on top of turning it off real quick lest I overflow my cup..again. So, in the future I will return to their regular bottles. If I had an empty I would pour this into that.<br /><br />The Dreft laundry detergent itself? LOVE IT. Smells SO GOOD... to me. Mmmmm<br /><br />I have been using Dreft products on and off since 2007. I do not have kids, but at some point I ended up with the stain remover spray, which is awesome stuff. Then I would buy the detergent once in awhile, especially for use with my cats and dogs bedding. I hadn't purchased any in a long time,  I think a lot of other gentle products came to market and I simply got away from it (not the stain remover though, still the best for me). Forward to this box of detergent. I really don't recall now what the detergent of the past smells like but I really like the way this smells. It is similar to a few others out there- floral, sweet. You may or may not like it. I like it. It works well with anything I have washed so far. If the scent has changed any, I understand why some would not like it-- sometimes we want what is familiar to use and what has worked.<br /><br />Really not sure why anyone would think this was fake? It is sold by Dreft, not a 3rd party. Go to their page and it is ALL Dreft items. Anyway.. the detergent works as expected. Smells good too! Box.. eh, I could do without that. Use it as a refill if you really want the box style and not have more bottles building up.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71VGA0jv7BL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71VGA0jv7BL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71VGA0jv7BL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B084WB8LJC,B0B4Z2PMHZ,AF2BLE54TEMGZ546U763ZHZRXC4A,2020-08-22 15:49:00.828,0,False,631,"('NEGATIVE', 0.8007956147193909)",NEGATIVE,0.8007956147193909
5,"60 ssoftgels/30 day supply, 2500mg fish oil, mild lemon taste, easy to swallow large softgels","These are big softgels, but they are easy to swallow. So smooth. The 60 softgel bottle is a 30 day supply. Just two a day provides 2500 mg of fish oil,  EPA 900 mg, DHA 600 mg, Other Omega-3 Fatty Acids 300 mg. This is a good amount!<br /><br />I have no problem taking this-- swallowing big smooth softgels dont bother me, I get no stomach upset, and not even any fishy tastes. Hint of lemon. I keep it at my desk and have it shortly after my first meal of the day.  I take fish oil for my health, as we all should! More specifically to keep my cholesterol on check. All the other is bonus. I got remiss on taking fish caps. I normally buy liquid as it is usually easier to find the higher amount, and many of the soft gels types that I have tried have been woefully low (like, maybe 10% of this). I was working through some low dose/tiny softgels. I really need to get back to taking larger amounts, daily. The Vimerson Health Fish Oil Omega 3 has allowed me to do that. Sometimes I add in my other softgels later in the day, or take a swig of my liquid fish oil (my doctor said I can up to 5000mg daily- so I can double what I take of this, or just use up my other stuff).<br /><br />Some fish caps and liquids can have a fishy aftertaste/burp. I am not sure what causes that-- whether it is the formula, or when it is taken. I haven't had that issue with these, but I do take them after I eat in the morning.<br /><br />I included pics of the softgels, the measurement, and even of one in my mouth. I suppose one could pop the soft gels and empty it out onto a spoon, or food. But really, these go down super easy... unlike tablets, capsules and softgels tend to be like that.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712dfNcSoZL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712dfNcSoZL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712dfNcSoZL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/815G5i09lQL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/815G5i09lQL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/815G5i09lQL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81YggL3gpGL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81YggL3gpGL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81YggL3gpGL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07TVPSS9T,B07TVPSS9T,AF2BLE54TEMGZ546U763ZHZRXC4A,2020-07-10 15:15:38.346,1,False,632,"('NEGATIVE', 0.980778694152832)",NEGATIVE,0.980778694152832

Is an antioxidant, and mobilizes other antioxidants in the body<br />Enchinacea—also called purple coneflower a very popular herb in the world for treating cold, flu, pain, and inflammation<br /><br />The hard facts: the human body does Not produce Zinc or C’s.  We do digest this in foods we eat.  However, I’m not always the most healthiest eater.  So, supplements can play a major factor in my body.  In one tablet (hard pill form) I get 889% of C’s, 455% Zinc, and for added protection Enchinacea 600mg.  All of these are in good high dose range.  I’m also sure my body can’t readily absorb all of these amounts,  however taking them I feel as if I will never lack these 3.<br /><br />No side affect from this for me, and I feel it will ward off some common illnesses.<br /><br />Trust you found this review honest and helpful:-)","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/816n5rMA8FL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/816n5rMA8FL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/816n5rMA8FL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Tea4KcLEL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Tea4KcLEL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Tea4KcLEL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08L8DB3LK,B08L8DB3LK,AFKMX6JZ655VPVYHBTATZQS4IBOQ,2021-03-01 03:17:53.662,0,False,655,"('POSITIVE', 0.9963196516036987)",POSITIVE,0.9963196516036987

5,"Makes awesome iced over windows, truly amazing at this!","SO a couple of things I noticed- I did this on a day where the back half of the house was in full sun and the front was in shade. The windows in the back were super hot and the crystals from this started showing instantly and seemed to come out better. So people with poor results on this might try heating up the window with a blow dryer first or something if it's cold out. The front windows still did decent, just took them some time to dry and the crystals to show up.<br /><br />I can say from experience- don't overdo it all at once on a window! If you do then you'll get runs in your crystals and it detracts from them a bit. So lightly spray the window and let it dry for a bit and once it's dry to touch, decide if you need to follow up with another coat.<br /><br />Pro tip, if you want it to look professional then use a piece of cardboard along the edges as you spray or tape all of your window trim with masking tape before spraying this. Especially around darker window frames. If you have white window frames then it probably wouldn't be an issue. I have dark brown aluminum frame windows and the over spray of this looks kinda junky. It does wipe off though so I just have to find time and go out and wipe the edges down for a cleaner look.<br /><br />Overall I'm truly amazed by the frozen window look these created!

I know, it's driving me crazy too because it's this strong striking scent that you think you know but then when you think about it, you really have no idea. Then I tried it. Worst mistake ever. It's like battery acid meets stomach bile, except I'd rather drink that. The worst part is while I was very hesitant to even try this after smelling it, I was like I've tried things that smelled horrible, tried it, and honestly it was awesome. However, me being dumb and super thirsty I ended up downing half a bottle before wanting to rip my tongue out. It's messed up because it started out totally fine until you stop drinking and then the smell turns into the taste. My tongue is still mad at me, and I don't blame it. I still have remnants of the smell and then it reminds me of the taste and I spit up a bit. Yeah, it's gross. It's more than gross, seriously don't buy this stuff. And being someone that drinks zero sugar drinks and sugar-free stuff, it's not this being sugar-free.<br />On another note, I wish everything came with the little scoops that Glytch uses. It's a scoop and funnel in one and is totally genius.

I have tried household basics like paper towels, cotton shop towels and brown paper rolls but they all have a flaw that makes then difficult to use. When I am working with products, like prepping a model for a very clean mold, I cannot introduce lint, as I would with cotton towels. I have to be aware of chemical compatibilities, and paper towels usually contain clay for extra absorbancy and make dust. Brown paper slides on the surface, and does not always help with all spills. I felt like I had to choose the lesser of evils. These pads are exactly what I have been looking for, but simply did not know what they were called. I like the  polyethylene backing, which can hold up against mild solvents like isopropyl alcohol. I appreciate the company also features domestic contact information on the package.

Two sets of gloves that are unlined that feel just like a second skin - providing the ultimate in dexterity while still protecting your hands.  And the other two pairs of gloves are flocked with a cotton liner making them not only easier to get on and take off but softer and providing some protection from hot dish water.<br /><br />On both types of gloves, the tips of the fingers are reinforced giving extra durability yet still allowing for excellent dexterity and range of motion.

This is a great improvement in being able to use this product correctly.  I did wear this but still found that after one hour or so, the straps loosened so I had to keep adjusting them.  Also the strap that goes under one’s armpit started to hurt.  I asked several friends of varying heights and weights, to try this product and they had similar feedback re: discomfort under the armpit when wearing it for more than 15 minutes.  I really like the idea, but perhaps consider narrowing the part that goes under the arm pit and widening the part that goes on top of the shoulder...

5,Very comfortable and comes with great accessories,This has been one crazy year. We have all had to get face masks or learn how to make our own. Thanks to COVID this has become a common day task that we wear these at work or out and about on errands and such. For some tasks I prefer wearing washable cloth masks and for others I prefer using a disposable type. At work we are only allowed to use the disposable N95 type masks but thankfully those are supplied to us.<br /><br />When I run errands or in my personal life I prefer to wear the more comfortable and reusable cloth masks. In this pack you get 2 black masks. In addition you get a storage pouch for when you are out and about to keep your mask in. You also get a pouch to wash your masks in. This is a nice set of masks that is very comfortable to wear. It fits very well above the nose and under the chin.  This one is very comfortable and fits well. The cotton is very soft and comfortable to wear. They have a metal clip on the nose to make them fit better. They also have adjustable loops to make sure the masks stay put and fit well. All int all this is a good mask that I like to wear quite a bit. At $15 this is not a bad price at all plus you can use the accessories for any of your other masks really.,[],B08MWQT6VC,B09DR976VR,AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,2021-03-07 19:18:08.714,0,False,798,"('POSITIVE', 0.9968284964561462)",POSITIVE,0.9968284964561462

Yes they are fermented a special way and undergo some special process but really? 5 plums, and we are talking tiny little plums for $18?<br /><br />The plums themselves do not taste good. They don’t taste horrible but they don’t taste good, not even close. I found they are just whatever really. You kind of just force them down and hope they help. Sadly I can’t really say that they helped, not even close. I think you would have to take quite a few of them to do that and at basically just over $3 per plum, that is just not going to happen, sorry.<br /><br />So it was worth the experiment but sad to say it was a failed experiment.

For some tasks I prefer wearing washable cloth masks and for others I prefer using a disposable type. In this pack you get 10 reusable, washable face masks for just $10, and as they say, you get what you pay for.<br /><br />The basically have the look and feel of disposable masks. They are three ply masks and are made of 2 layers. They are not adjustable in regards to the ear loops but you can adjust them at the nose a little bit with a nose clip. The material claims to be cotton but it is not the best material to be honest. I for one really do not like these very much. These are like back-up masks in my eyes when all my others are in the wash.<br /><br />I am sadly very underwhelmed with these.

5,Adds the little extra to your soaking bath time,"Who doesn’t like bath bombs? Well clearly if you are on here you do and you are in the right place if you ask me. These bath bombs are great. They are a very nice generous size which means they last a nice long time giving you a nice longer experience while you enjoy your nice soaking bath. The fragrances these have are fantastic. I tend to be very picky when it comes to fragrances and love that this one has a huge variety  from citrus to flowers to “plain” vanilla.<br /><br />You get a total of 12 of these bath bombs for just over $20 which is a good deal in my eyes and well worth it. These come in a very nice box that also lends perfectly to gift these for the holidays but also for birthdays but really any occasion if you ask me. I will probably have to get these again when I am out.

5,Good deal for what you are paying,"This is a pretty good kit for making face masks a bit more tolerable and easier to be honest. For one you get 12 brackets that keep the face masks a bit more of your face. I like that these are washable and reusable. These don’t have a lot of material to them which is nice, makes them feel a lot more airy unlike some others. They do have little snags that helps you snag them onto the face masks, but the snags are not the greatest and it makes it not that easy to attach them to those 3 ply fold-able disposable face masks but you can make it work. More practice eventually leads in better results.<br /><br />Then you get 2 of those lanyard straps which I like. You can attach your face mask to that and when you don’t use it, like if you are out to dinner and you are eating and don’t have a place to put it, you can just hang it around your neck instead. I really like this so much better than any other solution out there like those little wallets for face masks.<br /><br />Lastly you get those ear protectors, little straps that you can attach the face masks behind your head to instead of securing the face masks to your ear and straining your ears. You get a lot of them. These are fairly cheap but they work. You get so many in fact that if they break who cares and you have still so many that you can share with friends, family and coworkers if you are so inclined. All this for $17, not a bad deal really. I think it is worth it and all these little gadgets help making wear masks a little bit more tolerable.",[],B08G1TJG37,B08G1TJG37,AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,2020-09-26 00:07:54.937,0,False,802,"('POSITIVE', 0.6379770040512085)",POSITIVE,0.6379770040512085
4,Nice set of roll-on essential oils,"These are very nice essential oil roll-ons. You get a total of 4 different blends in this little relaxation kits. The tranquility  blend is a mix of vetiver, cedarwood and chamomile. It is a very nice woodsy aroma that smells great. The piece out blend is a mi of lavender, orange and bergamot, probably my favorite. It is a beautiful blend that is just perfect to apply before you head to bed. Tension is a blend that contains peppermint and wintergreen and to be honest I am not a huge fan to that one, mostly because I am rather sensitive to mind. Ache is the last one and contains Arnica and Frankincense to help with inflammation bruising and sprains. That one smells a bit rougher but it is supposed to help with inflammation and does seem to help maybe a little bit.<br /><br />That one is applied directly to the affected area while tension is applied best to the temples since it helps with headaches a little bit. The other two can be applied to the temples or pulse points to distribute their effects. These are easy to apply and use. Their scents are pretty mild and sadly do fade fairly quickly all considering. I like that they come in these easy little applicator roll-ons that are easy to bring along really. All in all nice little set that also makes for a good gift.",[],B07Z6PXX55,B07Z6PXX55,AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,2020-09-25 15:54:21.184,0,False,803,"('POSITIVE', 0.9995145797729492)",POSITIVE,0.9995145797729492
4,Very nice makeup removal pads,"These are nice makeup removal pads. You get a jar with 70 of these pads that are soaked with the removal solution. And of course when you are done there is some of that solution on the bottom that you can use with regular cotton pads. These makeup pads are very nice and work well. The removal solution is very gentle, probably because it includes cica solution in it as well as some vitamins and other good ingredients.<br /><br />They smell very good and I found are gentle enough to use around the eyes. I had no issues removing foundation, lipsticks are eye makeup. All in all I am very happy with these. The price is rather reasonable too at $12 for 70 of these pads. I think these should be good for sensitive people except may the fragrance that is fairly strong but pleasant.

3,More expensive face mask lanyards - still work as advertised,"I like these face mask lanyards. They are perfect to attach your face masks to. You attach one end to each side of your face masks. Then when you don’t use your face mask, like for example if you are taking a break to eat or you are at a restaurant, you can then take it down and just hang it around your neck using this lanyard. No more leaving it on the desk, putting it over your thigh or anything like that. So much easier and better. Especially when you are out for dinner I always struggle on what to do with it and this is the solution. Or when you are driving in your car and you just need to put it away for a bit, this is the solution. These can also be used as ear extenders / ear savers meaning  the face mask is attached to the lanyard and around the head, relieving the pressure on the ears.<br /><br />I like it because it makes it easy to put the face mask safely away but close by and you don’t have to put them down anywhere but instead they hang around your neck. In this pack you get 4 of them for just $16. These are definitely some of the more expensive ones out there and not sure why they are more expensive, because of the “design”?  I always keep some around since it is easy to misplace them and I just keep them on the various cloth masks I have in the car and so on so having a few of the on hand is very handy.",[],B08DKFYSX2,B08DKFYSX2,AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,2020-09-20 02:44:53.946,0,False,805,"('POSITIVE', 0.9577570557594299)",POSITIVE,0.9577570557594299
5,Very nice mini dustpan and brush set,"When I read mini dustpan, I thought this one would be a little bit smaller than it is. It is pretty small but I was hoping a little smaller. I do like it though and it is very versatile. The pan makes collecting the dirt easy. The brush has a brush side on one end and a squeegee side on another. This is perfect for making sure you get all the dirt.<br /><br />I like that the brush neatly stores within the pan. In addition they give you a small little brush that works very well in cleaning out dirt from your keyboard or other small areas. I actually use this for cleaning out the cage of my flying squirrels, it makes a job that usually takes me closer to 5 to 10 minutes a 1 minute task.<br /><br />The materials are also perfect that if they ever get dirty you can just clean it easily with soap and water.",[],B08BF9JX5S,B08BF9JX5S,AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,2020-09-06 02:27:52.452,0,False,806,"('POSITIVE', 0.9993334412574768)",POSITIVE,0.9993334412574768
4,"Very nice earplugs that reduce noise, but don't block it out completely",These are good earplugs. They work well in reducing noise and protect your hearing but they will not completely drown out all noise. You get a cute little carrying case with a carabiner that let's you attach it to your purse or luggage or whatever really. Inside the case is a sturdy foam with 6 holes in it in which the 3 pairs of earplugs are inserted into. Each pair has different colored plastic so you can keep the pairs together.<br /><br />The earplugs fit very well and I have had no issues with them falling out. The soft silicone material is actually pretty comfortable. The way these are made you can actually lay on your side sleeping and be comfortable with them. They reduce noise nicely but you can still hear what is going on to some degree.<br /><br />These are well made. The materials are nice and can easily be washed. You can take the silicon of the plastic to allow proper cleaning of both really. When not in use you can store everything safely in the carrying case.,[],B089NCVP7Q,B089NCVP7Q,AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,2020-08-03 01:09:19.444,0,False,807,"('POSITIVE', 0.9968452453613281)",POSITIVE,0.9968452453613281

3,Just ok in my eyes - high amount of calories for what you are getting,"This is just an average hydration supplement in my eyes. First of it comes at 160 calories for one serving, which I think is rather high. Most energy workout boosters come at like 50 calories or less but this one has quite a bit of sugar in it. It does have a good amount of electrolytes so that is nice, you can basically make your own quick version of Gatorade of sorts. Again a lot of calories though. The electrolytes are mostly sodium and potassium, both important for muscle function and many other functions inside the human body.<br /><br />I tend to dilute it more than instructed since it is pretty sweet. The taste is not bad but among the energy boosters I have tried this is not my favorite, it is ok. I have had no negative reactions to this but didn't really feel any energy boosting effects from this at all since they do claim some energy boosting effects calling it an energy blend.<br /><br />All in all this is just ok. You do get a massive amount for the $20 though so you can make a lot of home made ""Gatorade"" with this really.

I think taking a supplement works better than a topical application (i.e. shampoo or conditioner) but trying both may work best?<br /><br />My nails have been breaking a lot and my hair is on the thinner side. So it is more than time to do something about it. Taking this supplement has definitely helped, I can notice the difference in my nails.

It is very inexpensive and probably not the most accurate instrument out there, however I do like it to get a rough idea on how much blood alcohol level I have. Would I stake my drivers license on this, of course not but it is nice to get an idea on where I am standing really.

When you use the cleaning and moisturizing settings you should use a cleaning solution or moisturizing solution of sort.<br /><br />The facial scrubber is a nice lightweight little unit that sits comfortably in your hand. It is very easy to operate and easy to use, you just have to figure out which setting you want to use. I really like using this. It is much gentler in cleaning blackheads and such then squeezing them with your fingers or using those blackhead tools that often damage your skin and also hurt. This is nice and gentle and actually feels good.

4,Nice two in one,"This earmuffs/eye mask combination is pretty neat. It is one piece that combines an eye mask with earmuffs to give you better sleep. The straps are adjustable to make them tighter or looser obviously and fit better for your needs. I found I don't like it super tight since that makes it a bit uncomfortable on the eyes especially if you end up opening your eyes at one point while wearing the mask.<br /><br />The mask is soft so if you do open your eyes at some point your eye lashes will touch the mask, that is a tad annoying but not a deal breaker since you should be sleeping anyways. The earmuffs are pretty noise insulating but do not block out all noise. But I found they do a pretty good job. For those who like to sleep on the side these are soft and comfortable enough to do so, although for an entire night on the same side I don't think it is optimal. I move around from the sides to back a bit so this worked well for me.<br /><br />They are pretty well made in my eyes so they should last a good amount of time. I think the thing that will probably go first are the straps that hold everything together. These should be great especially on a flight if you are trying to get a little snooze.

Finally I brought it out, set it up and have been using it ever since.<br /><br />FLOOR STAND<br />This has a heavy floor stand and it works well to hold the lamp steady.<br /><br />LIGHT CONTROL<br />The controls go from high to medium and off.  It is easy to hit the rocker switch sitting in a chair.<br /><br />LIGHT QUALITY<br />This light is fantastic quality.  I can see well when doing artwork, knitting, or sewing.

It does not affect operation of the light, however.<br /><br />BULB<br />I am still on the original bulb, but bought a backup in case.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This light is fantastic.

5,Seems To Be Supportive- Clear Which Surprised Me,"When I first got this, I expected it to be brown like other products from these sources.<br /><br />HOW THIS COMES<br />This comes in a large plastic bottle.  There is a seal on top that needs to be removed.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />Instead of brown like other products made from these sources, this is clear.  There is no flavor or scent.  Shaking it up does not seem to change that.<br /><br />FLAVOR?<br />No flavor.<br /><br />HOW TO TAKE<br />I take a teaspoon of this once a day in the morning in a small cup of water.<br /><br />DOES IT DO ANYTHING?<br />I seem to see a bit of support in energy, sleep, and overall.  I am taking this in the dead of winter where it has been near zero for almost a month straight.  I am usually dragging and very tired and worn during this period.  I have been taking this along with a few supplements and I am doing remarkably well.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This supplement seems to be supportive through a very difficult cold and dry winter.  I am usually tired, but taking this, I am not.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  This seems to be working for me.  I am not sure why there is no flavor or color, but it is helping somewhat so I will finish the bottle.",[],B09Q9CYZWF,B09Q9CYZWF,AHMG3ALUBE3FEBHODTBHP5J24YDA,2022-02-07 19:26:35.532,5,False,917,"('NEGATIVE', 0.993359386920929)",NEGATIVE,0.993359386920929
3,That Would Be $60 A Month If Taken As Directed,"I was very interested to try this supplement as I like to take most of what is in the pills for immunity especially during the stressful winter months.  I did not realize that a bottle only lasts 10 days if taken as directed.<br /><br />SIZE<br />The pill size is standard and not hard to swallow.<br /><br />ODOR<br />The odor of the pills is not excessive or intense.<br /><br />DIGESTIVE ISSUES<br />I had no issues with burping, upset stomach, or other digestive problems when taking this.<br /><br />HOW I TOOK THIS<br />I took this as two capsules a day when I was feeling a bit under the weather.<br /><br />DID IT HELP?<br />I did see that it helped me just by taking 2 capsules in a day.<br /><br />HOW IS THIS SUPPOSED TO BE TAKEN?<br />I was shocked when I read the instructions to take SIX capsules a day which amounts to this bottle only lasting 10 days.  That means at $20 a bottle (at the time of this review) that you would be paying $60 a month to take this supplement.  I am not sure it is worth that.<br /><br />COUNTRY OF ORIGIN?<br />This says on the bottle that it is manufactured FOR a place in FL and FORMULATED in the US, but it does not say where it is actually made that I can find on the bottle.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Although this helped me some at a lesser dose than recommended, if taken as it says, it is pretty expensive.  I am not sure it is worth it to get 3 bottles a month.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />THREE STARS.  Although it does work, it is a bit high priced and the bottle contains so little compared to monthly recommendations, I can not rate this higher than 3 stars.",[],B093ZBSBP2,B093ZBSBP2,AHMG3ALUBE3FEBHODTBHP5J24YDA,2021-09-27 16:11:57.596,0,False,918,"('NEGATIVE', 0.9873045086860657)",NEGATIVE,0.9873045086860657

The fill line is about where the top of the yellow label is.  It really should be a bit fuller than it was.<br /><br />EASY TO TAKE?<br />This is not difficult to take.  It is warm water to activate and then add cool water to drink it.<br /><br />FLAVOR?<br />I did not find the flavor offensive.  Some of the magnesium drinks have lots of stevia which makes me gag.  This one was not like that for me at all.  It is actually pleasant to take uncluttered with sweetners.<br /><br />DOES IT HELP<br />This is really helpful to relax me at night.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This powder is pleasant to take.  It is not cluttered with stevia or other additives.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS. I am thrilled to have this without lots of extra flavors and enhancers added.

5,Seems To Help Rebuilding Muscle For More Rehab Style Workouts,"I have had some serious stress this past year (in addition to everything else we all have experienced).  It has taken a toll on my body.  I decided to start working out slowly to regain muscle mass and strength again.  I figured that this would help avoid some of the pain involved.<br /><br />JAR<br />The jar is a decent size.  It is not oversized like so many of them.  It is filled up completely and comes with a scoop.<br /><br />DOSAGE<br />I scoop is recommended daily first thing in the morning and then post workout if you work out that day.  The scoop looks to be about a teaspoon.<br /><br />FLAVOR<br />There is no flavor at all to this.  Stirring it in water does not add anything in flavor to the water in my experience.<br /><br />DOES IT MIX IN WELL?<br />This mixes in very well.  I did not get any problems with lumping or anything left undissolved in the glass.<br /><br />DOES IT HELP?<br />I have not experienced extreme pain while taking this.  I have not had any remarkable results, however either.  Usually I would be in a lot of pain when working out, but this seems to take the edge off.  I am not a body builder, however, so my progress is slow on purpose more for rehab type of muscle building.<br /><br />DIGESTIVE ISSUES?<br />I have had no issues while taking this so far.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This is easy to take, has not flavor, seems to help take the edge off and comes in a decently small jar.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS. I give it five stars because it seems to help some, is flavorless as stated, and it does not have any additives either.  It is a bit pricey, but then again, you are not paying for fillers either.",[],B08K3LYK2C,B08K3LYK2C,AHMG3ALUBE3FEBHODTBHP5J24YDA,2021-02-15 14:50:15.532,0,False,921,"('NEGATIVE', 0.9872252345085144)",NEGATIVE,0.9872252345085144
5,"Although I Prefer Fresh Wheatgrass Juice, This Is A Great Substitute","I love fresh wheatgrass juice.  Sometimes, however, I can not get the wheatgrass so I am limited to what I can find that is available like this.  Let's take a look.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This is a WHEATGRASS JUICE powder.  That is important because you are not getting all of the fiber like wheatgrass powder has which tastes awful.  It is a bright green and needs to be kept sealed in the foil bag it came in.<br /><br />HOW TO USE IT?<br />I have found the best way to use wheatgrass is alone.  In absolute dire necessity fresh apple juice will go with it, but anything else tends to give an upset stomach.  I put a tsp of powder in a small glass of water, put it in my tiny cordless blender, blend it up and drink it.<br /><br />HOW DOES IT TASTE?<br />As much as I prefer fresh wheatgrass juice, this is a decent substitute.  I did not find it repulsive or difficult to drink and it is a pretty green color too.  Some might find the flavor a bit over whelming, but I like it.<br /><br />DOES IT HELP?<br />Believe it or not, it does help some.  Not as much as fresh juice, but it still does perk me up a bit.<br /><br />OTHER USE?<br />I use a tiny bit of juice in our cat's homemade food on the winter time.  That way she is getting some greens but not in an overwhelming amount.  She loves it.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This is a great way to get wheatgrass juice if you don't have any way to get fresh.  It should be kept sealed and consumed regularly until gone and kept in the refrigerator once opened to keep it fresher.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  I am glad to have this and am surprised at how good it is compared to others I have had which I did not like.  I would buy it again.",[],B0842BFTBV,B07PXHS4P1,AHMG3ALUBE3FEBHODTBHP5J24YDA,2020-08-24 16:26:22.555,3,False,922,"('POSITIVE', 0.9614915251731873)",POSITIVE,0.9614915251731873
5,I Was Surprised At How Nice This Is,"I have always had sensitive teeth since I was a kid.  Finding toothpaste that is good for sensitive teeth, tastes good, and cleans well is not always easy.  This time, I think I found a winner!<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS TOOTHPASTE LIKE?<br />This toothpaste is not a white paste more of a paste gel.  It has a really nice mojito flavor that is not sweet but still tastes good at the same time.  There is a flip top on it and the tube is plastic.<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS PERFORM?<br />I have used it for half the tube now and it seems to help with sensitive teeth.  I also feel that it cleans the teeth well too.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />I like this toothpaste/gel.  It tastes good, is unusual, but seems to work well for my sensitive teeth.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS so far.  This is a nice product.  I would probably buy again if it continues to perform well over time.  I have two more tubes to go through.

4,"Great For Rehydrating Especially  After Bout Of ""The Runs""","I have been trying to build up my system with minerals in my water, but not too long ago, I had a bout with the runs- the kind that leave you feeling rather exhausted after a day of running to the bathroom.  I noticed that I was feeling very ill and weak the next day or two, then it dawned on me.  I thought I would try this..<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This stuff is thickened in a bottle which has a twist of raspberry flavoring added.  It is not sweet, just has a raspberry essence.  There is no sweetener, and the dropper has measuring lines on it.<br /><br />HOW TO USE THIS?<br />I was so run down when I got thinking about it, I remembered- you can easily get dehydrated when having ""the runs"".  I immediately got out this electrolyte mixture and put a small amount of this (like.25) into a very large glass of water.  I drank it down as gradually as I could and then through the day I added more water.<br /><br />By the end of the morning, I was feeling TONS better.  This really did help me rehydrate and feel better after being wiped out.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This is not hard to take, has just a bit of raspberry flavor, but does help me to rehydrate when I really need help.  I experienced relief greatly after having a bout with ""the runs""  I plan to use a little bit now and then to continue to rehydrate this winter.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS.  I love that this helped me through a rough patch when I needed hydration.  I am torn between five and four stars for review.  I am VERY glad there is not heavy sweetener in this like so many things have.  I also am kind of unclear on ingredients or this company.

5,I am SO HAPPY To Have This Not Only For Juice But Keto Red Forest Cake!,"When it comes to winter, sometimes we don't always have access to the vegetables that we want to have.  I love to have juice, but sometimes it just is not possible to get fresh vegetables at times.  Having this powder is a great alternative.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS POWDER LIKE?<br />This powder comes in a great packaging which seems to keep the powder dry very nicely.  It is cut open and then you can reseal it.  The powder is raw beets, but is freeze dried so you HAVE to keep this closed at all times, before and after you access it.<br /><br />HOW DO I USE IT?<br />I either put this in my vegetable juice that I make fresh and blend it in my hand blender, or if desperate, I add it to cold water and drink it in my mini blender.  I also have used it to make a Keto version of red forest cake which is OUT OF THIS WORLD, by the way.  You just have to add more liquid to counteract the powder.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />For a great way to get beet juice into your diet when vegetables are not handy, this is an excellent alternative.  The powder is easy to use, tastes fresh and mixes well either in fresh juice or water, or you can use it in recipes too.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  I LOVE how versatile it is and between the juice and red forest keto cake, I am most likely going to keep this in my cupboard when I run out- I will buy more.",[],B07VNH1Z16,B07XVVVB8W,AHMG3ALUBE3FEBHODTBHP5J24YDA,2019-11-18 18:50:08.818,5,False,925,"('POSITIVE', 0.9972993731498718)",POSITIVE,0.9972993731498718

Let's take a look at this one.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This comes in a bag which is pretty good at insulating against moisture and air, if you open it correctly.  Just cutting below the plastic seal allows for enough room to re-zip the bag shut.<br /><br />THE POWDER<br />The powder inside is very fresh smelling.  I have had spirulina which tastes overwhelming and others which tastes almost gaggy.  This one, however, is not unpleasant like some I have had.<br /><br />SCOOP<br />This comes with a small scoop inside to measure for smoothies.<br /><br />TASTE<br />I am not minding this one.  The last spirulina powder I had was a bit overwhelming for me.  This one does not take over the smoothies in the same way.  It is earthy in flavor but not repulsive.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />For a good raw source of spirulina for shakes, smoothies, baking, or supplementation this seems to be a bit nicer than some.  It does not taste bad and it comes with a measure scoop.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  One of my favorite spirulina powders so far that I have tried.  It is very fresh smelling.",[],B07VRRK18B,B07XVVVB8W,AHMG3ALUBE3FEBHODTBHP5J24YDA,2019-08-28 18:15:57.945,14,False,926,"('POSITIVE', 0.9952687621116638)",POSITIVE,0.9952687621116638
5,Great Substitute When You Can Not Get Fresh Wheatgrass,"I try to make a regular habit of having wheatgrass juice on a regular basis, but sometimes when I can not get fresh wheatgrass, it is nice to have alternatives.  Let's see how this measures up.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This wheatgrass powder is freeze dried.  It comes in a re-sealable bag which has a measuring cup inside.  It is a nice green color and smells nice, not as awful as some wheatgrass that I have used in the past in powder form.<br /><br />HOW DO I USE THIS?<br />I have a little cordless blender which is a handheld one for one serving.  I put a cup of cold water in my blender and a scoop full of powder in with it.  I blend one or two cycles to make sure the lumps are gone and then I drink it.<br /><br />FLAVOR?<br />This is not as good as fresh wheatgrass juice, but it is helpful to get fresh green juice into my diet.  It is not like dried grass like some other wheatgrass powders I have used which don't taste too great.  This one tastes a bit greener, if that makes sense.<br /><br />HOW SOON TO USE IT UP?<br />Because this is freeze dried, I opt to put it into a glass jar with oxygen absorbers to seal it when not in use.  Freeze dried powder is important to either use up quickly (like a month or two) or seal it up as I have explained.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />For a good substitute for fresh wheatgrass if you have not got that option, this powder is handy.  I find it helpful to use in my personal cordless blender to boost energy and get green juice into my diet when fresh is not available.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />Five stars.  One of the better wheatgrass powders I have tried over the years.  I would buy it again.",[],B07JVC7WJN,B07XVVVB8W,AHMG3ALUBE3FEBHODTBHP5J24YDA,2019-03-24 16:12:39.115,6,False,927,"('POSITIVE', 0.9025185108184814)",POSITIVE,0.9025185108184814

Ashwagandha has been a good way for many people to help deal with stress.  Let's see how this supplement has helped with that.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This powder comes in a resealable container with a measure scoop.  The powder is raw powdered herb.  The package says that this is often used for managing stress and supporting virility.  Let's see how this performed.<br /><br />HOW DID WE USE THIS?<br />I put this in my smoothie a few times a week when I make them in the morning.  I have to say that I did see an increased ability to handle stress and also it did seem to boost virility too.<br /><br />IS IT EFFECTIVE?<br />So far I am seeing a definite improvement in both things as laid out on the package.<br /><br />TASTE/SMELL?<br />The smell and taste are not bad at all.  The taste is slightly bitter but not bad at all.  I find that it does not ruin smoothie flavor or leave awful aftertaste.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />For a well packaged powder that comes with a scoop, is great to add to sauces, food, smoothies, etc, this product seems to do what is says.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />Five stars.  I would definitely buy this again.  I like having it handy.  I plan to get my husband to start taking it daily too.

4,"If You Like A Bite To Your Smoothies, This Is A Healthy One!","I am always looking for new natural supplements to put in my green smoothies.  We tend to eat more healthy around my house, so this looked really intriguing to me.  Let's see how it performed..<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS POWDER LIKE?<br />This powder is green and comes in a foil re-sealed package.  It also comes with a little scoop to measure with.<br /><br />ODOR?<br />This has very little odor.<br /><br />TASTE?<br />This does taste like gooseberries without the severe tart twist that our bushes of gooseberries have.<br /><br />HOW DOES IT PERFORM IN SMOOTHIES?<br />I find that using a scoop in a Vitamix sized smoothie is not enough to alter the taste so much that people won't drink it.  This powder ads a bit of a twist to the smoothie that I find refreshing.  It is not that bad and if I dip my finger in the powder and eat it, it is almost a buttery slightly tart feeling.<br /><br />ANY REACTIONS?<br />We have had no bad reactions to this.  As for vitamin C, in the winter, I love having this available to put in smoothies as Vitamin C tends to be REALLY sour in nature.  This is far nicer to have.  Keep in mind it is only a tiny bit of Vitamin C and not therapeutic amounts.  This is not for battling sickness.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />For a nice natural additive to smoothies or other foods that increase nutritional content but don't overwhelm taste, this is a nice powder.  I have enjoyed using it for quite a few weeks now.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />I am giving this four stars.  It is pleasant tasting and not overwhelming and I like including it in smoothies.",[],B07J3F4KLJ,B07XVVVB8W,AHMG3ALUBE3FEBHODTBHP5J24YDA,2019-02-18 16:14:42.433,3,False,929,"('POSITIVE', 0.9271908402442932)",POSITIVE,0.9271908402442932
4,Great If You Need An Extra Cusion On The Ball Of The Foot,"Sometimes you get a pair of shoes that just is not comfortable.  The base of the shoe where the ball of the foot is, can be too thin and it can be hard on the feet.  These pads do seem to help, but let's take a closer look.<br /><br />WHAT ARE THESE PADS LIKE?<br />These pads are for the ball of the foot.  They have a place for the area under the toes so you know where to put them.  The backing is a type which will hold into place pretty well.  It can be washed and reused.  The cushion has some flock on it which keeps it soft instead of overly rubbery.<br /><br />HOW DO THESE PERFORM?<br />So far, I have a pair on one of my shoes.  The pad did make the shoe slightly tighter, but that pair had the room.  If the shoes are really fitted, they could make it too tight.  The pad did not seem to slide around that much and so far they have been good. If I am not careful, however, they will slide.<br /><br />FUTURE UPDATES?<br />I will continue to test them in other shoes, however and update my review if I have anything to add.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />For reusable pads for the ball of the foot in some shoes that just are too hard, these are nice.

5,Pretty amazing results already,"I ordered the 'Dental Duty Teeth Whitening Kit With 14 Non-Slip Whitestrips & Whitening Accelerator Light' for review.  I have had the opportunity to review several other whitening kits recently and this one by far has given my wife the best results.  She has completed six 20-minute sessions and already has had significant results.  Her additional thoughts:<br />• Compared to whitening pens or other trays, these are much easier to use.  You simply open the strips, place the larger strip on your top teeth and the smaller strip on your bottom teeth.  Be sure to get all the way down to your gums and press the strip to adhere closely to your teeth.  Then insert the light into the mouth tray and turn it on.<br />• The light has an automatic shut off at 10 minutes.  Just turn it back on once or twice dependent on the time you want to continue whitening.  I would not recommend nor does the instructions recommend any longer than a half hour.<br />• You do need to open the battery compartment to remove the paper between the two batteries to use it.<br />• The photos show her before pic along with after the first use and then after 6 uses.  The pictures were taken in the same spot in the house at the same time of day without a flash.<br />• Because these are strips versus a gel, you do not have anything draining into your mouth while you are whitening.  Once you turn off the light and remove the tray there is some saliva mixed with white foam.  She did not gag as much as with the gels.<br />• It may be too early to tell but, at this point this product has not caused any additional sensitivity to her teeth.<br />• This kit is less expensive then many other less comparable whitening kits.<br />Overall, my wife is happy with the results she has seen already.  She is looking forward to finishing a complete week. Once she does I will update my review with new after pictures.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61-kqYuIXlL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61-kqYuIXlL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61-kqYuIXlL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07Z9V4YQH,B07Z9V4YQH,AFLBMDZDIPCHMWWA7CXQXITPBJKA,2020-02-03 23:07:04.937,0,False,932,"('NEGATIVE', 0.7618417739868164)",NEGATIVE,0.7618417739868164
4,Contour keeps them from crushing your lashes,"I had the opportunity to review the Sytmhoe Sleep Mask for Men Women.  My wife travels to Alaska for work and she can have a difficult time sleeping during the summer when it does not get dark.  Plus, purple is her favorite color.  She took them recently on a trip and these were her thoughts:<br />• The mask will block out the light if you get it adjusted on your face correctly.  However, when I had full coverage, the elastic band was folded uncomfortably behind my ears.  When I would move it for better comfort, the light would shine through.<br />• They are well padded and comfortable on the face.<br />• The stitching is well done.  The adjustable band is reinforced to keep it secured and lessen the change of it tearing off.<br />• It is contoured so it does not sit flat on her eyes.  She does not wake up with mangled eyelashes.<br />• The elastic band has Velcro to adjust its length for a better fit.<br />Overall, this is a well-made sleep mask for the price.  My wife will use it when she needs to, but not on a regular basis at night of how the band fits too close to her ear.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81iM4EzNO9L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81iM4EzNO9L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81iM4EzNO9L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07XG76Q7P,B07XG76Q7P,AFLBMDZDIPCHMWWA7CXQXITPBJKA,2020-01-23 07:33:17.331,0,False,933,"('POSITIVE', 0.9555081725120544)",POSITIVE,0.9555081725120544
4,Very compact,"I ordered this set of Pill Case - 2 Pack Portable Travel Medicine and Vitamins Organizers. for review as my wife travels for work.  They are very well made.  The purple and pink are very pretty light colors.  It is compact enough to throw into her carry on bag or purse.  The main downfall to this case is that because it is compact 4 of the slots are 1/2 slots and don't always hold a full days supplements.  The compartments each have their own lids, which snap down tightly.  This is a plus in my book, because some of the compact pill carriers we have used,  are at times segmented but only have one snap lid over all the compartments.  Making it difficult to just get one day's dose from them.  My wife will have to take both of these when she travels in order to hold both her night and morning medications and supplements.  Overall, well made, just a little too compact for my wife.

3,Relative to offerings sadly this is the one to choose. The others are worse.,"I'm giving this product three stars, primarily due to the fact it is a knee scooter. And the pad where you put your knee is not very much padding at all in fact it's a willful attempted being a good pad and the covering that covers that is even worse. With very little use my wife having had foot surgery, the pad felt inadequate to begin and degrades very rapidly, and the fake leather whatever the covering is on it is made of is like starting to crack and maybe as durable as a wet paper towel maybe.<br />That's the bad stuff now the good stuff is in terms of mobility and functionality this thing offers quick release adjustment on the handlebars which is far far superior to most of the other brands which you have to take the pin all the way out unscrew it all the way take it all the way out adjust the handlebars and then you have to store it somewhere not very Mobile in my opinion so this one's light years ahead of all of those.  Overall I have to say compared to what else is on the market this thing is a pretty good value for the money but it still leaves a lot to be desired. Having said that it is the one that we finally purchased. Similar to how we vote in the United States, sadly we had to choose between the better piece of garbage.",[],B08T6Z7NMP,B08T6Z7NMP,AHNKVZEB42Q76COM4FKE3L5DMP2A,2021-06-11 17:52:53.092,0,True,935,"('NEGATIVE', 0.9984474778175354)",NEGATIVE,0.9984474778175354

4,Best Positioned Apex of Arch Support,"This is an edited review that includes my most recent experiences with these really very good insoles.  My rating (4 stars) remains the same.  It would be 5 stars with increased forefoot cushioning.<br />1.  First a note about sizing.<br />I wear size 10 extra wide sneakers.  I purchased a pair L - Women's 11-12.5 | Men's 10-11.5.  These were too long and too wide.  I cut them down to size.  In cutting them down to size, I had to assure that I cut them down to be no bigger than other insoles that I knew fit well in my shoes.<br />2.  Function<br />The RooRuns insoles are functioning better than all other brands of arch support insoles I have used and continue to use. Every other insole I've used, besides RooRuns Plantar Fasciitis Arch Support Insoles, has the apex of the arch support hitting the forward part of my heal bone.  I've seen an image from an insole manufacturer indicating that that is by design.  I believe I would be much more comfortable if the apex were about a quarter inch further forward.  And, that's where the cut-down-to-size RooRuns insoles have the arch apex!<br />I also bought a two pairs of  size M - Women's 9-10.5 | Men's 8-9.5.  These fit my shoes without need for cutting for size.  The arch apex of the size M insoles are significantly more forward of all the non-RooRuns insoles , but just short of the position of the RooRuns size L insoles.  I've done three 4+ mile runs and several long walks with RooRuns Plantar Fasciitis Arch Support Insoles, with the size M and the size L insoles, and my feet felt much much more comfortable than when I've used insoles from other manufacturers.  And, so have my knees.  The size L insoles are slightly more comfortable than the size M insoles.<br />All the RooRuns Plantar Fasciitis Arch Support Insoles could use more cushioning for the forefoot.  Thus, my rating is below 5 stars.",[],B094QRGPP6,B094QRGPP6,AFQUSPAVEGEVG7YACY3MGMWVZBQA,2022-11-11 00:53:22.228,0,False,941,"('NEGATIVE', 0.9939848780632019)",NEGATIVE,0.9939848780632019

I have these sorts of holders for every kind of battery I own, and they are all neatly stored in a ziplock bag in a box.

I even keep a couple in my hiking pack - no digging around the bottom of the bag for a stray AAA attempting an escape.<br /><br />If I am giving someone a gift which requires batteries, I will usually include a holder like this with it, filled with the appropriate type of lithium cells. The presentation is on-point and it ensure that not only can they use the gift immediately, but can continue to use it for the next couple years or so.<br /><br />The build quality is good, the batteries are easy to insert and remove, and the clear plastic leaves no question as to how many cells are in the holder and what sort of cells they are.<br /><br />Would recommend.",[],B019ZYUKM4,B019ZYUKM4,AHNOLQG5SZLLNGPOF3GAVRMQMQDQ,2020-04-29 14:14:20.837,0,True,1001,"('NEGATIVE', 0.6793614029884338)",NEGATIVE,0.6793614029884338

5,Scrub a dub dub,My hubby said &quot;wow my back feels incredible &quot; &quot;it feels so clean&quot; . I suppose it is safe to assume he really liked these back scrubbies. I like the size and you can easily stretch them to clean and then they go back. They don't take up a lot room. Hang easy on a suction cup hook. Fast to dry. Tight weave but not stiff. Knotted on both ends with loops to hold onto. Great quality. We usually buy the regular bath poufs but these easily fold to use all over the body. My toddler thinks they are hilarious and tries to wash with them. They are gentle enough for his skin even though they clean well. No funky smell when I opened them. 6 pack is very economical and these will store fine under the sink until needed.

5,Powdery scent on moist wipes,"Baby wipes sure have improved since I used them on my daughter who is now an adult.  Many options are available now and there are noticeable differences among the offerings in the marketplace.  I prefer the [[ASIN:B00DDMJ6NE Pampers Baby Fresh Wipes 3x Travel Pack 192 Count]] because I like the unscented variety, but these are very similar in form and function.  Having a powdery like scent, I imagine that these would remove lingering odors from the wiped body part and that's a good thing in many cases.  The wipe texture is similar but I think the [[ASIN:B00DDMJ6NE Pampers Baby Fresh Wipes 3x Travel Pack 192 Count]] are a little moister than the Natural Clear wipes.  In any case, both of these Pampers products are outstanding and I'm sold on replacing the generic and store brands I've been buying for many years.  Wipes are usable for so many purposes other than baby's bottoms.  I use them for removing makeup in a professional setting and use them daily for my dog's face and legs.  I tend to use the unscented variety for people with sensitivities but doubt that these will react with most people.  Nevertheless, it's nice to have both options available right now.  As with the other Pampers wipes, these are packaged in an attractive and lightweight plastic with a sturdy heavier plastic cap that's easy to open and close.  It seals very well and I expect especially in this variety that the wipes will remain moist unless they are uncapped or kept in heat for an extended period of time.<br /><br />Despite Amazon's image showing a package labeled as containing 192 wipes and packages of 72 wipes each, these do indeed contain 64 nice sized wipes in each package.

5,Now why didn't I think of this??,"We used to wash our yoga mats in the bathtub.  It's not the easiest thing to do since they are long and one of them is super thick.  We used to then drape it over the bathtub to let it dry, which took a few hours.  I had no idea there was a yoga mat cleaner out there.  I was ordering a bar of soap from this company and when I added it to my cart, it showed suggestions for other products and this was one of them.  I decided to take a chance and order it since the reviews were good and it seemed to have non-chemical ingredients.  I would never use a traditional cleaner on the mat since our skin directly touches it and I didn't want the material of the yoga mat to deteriorate.  So when I got this, I tried it out on one section of the mat and it seemed to work great.  I got the non scented one since my husband would not be thrilled with his yoga mat smelling &#34;fruity&#34; or &#34;florally&#34;. I have now used it several times on both of our mats and this works great and is a much easier process than our original method of getting them clean.  I love that this comes with a cleaning cloth so I can just throw both of them in the workout bag instead of having to pack an extra towel.

5,Cold Remedy that Really Works,For the past couple of years I've hardly been sick at all. I take my vitamin C daily and I think that helps. But recently I was around someone who was coughing and touching everything and spreading their cold everywhere. It was very frustrating to realize that I was probably going to get sick.<br /><br />Well I had one day of feeling like I was getting a cold and I took this four times a day as prescribed. Wow I'm not sick. This stuff really must work. I found the taste inconsequential. In a glass of water I could not taste it at all. One dropper full in water is the recommended dose. It is about 25 drops of liquid. I counted it to be sure.<br /><br />Buying this may seem expensive but how much is your health worth? To me it was well worth the cost and this bottle will last a long time as you use so little. When they say you will be well in a day they really mean it.<br /><br />I was very impressed with this remedy and will keep it on hand at all times. It works better than anything I've tried before. I even told my nurse practitioner about it and she thought it was good.<br /><br />Who wants to be sick for a week or more. I just don't have the time.

4,Deeper Sleep,When my generic Ambien doesn't work I get out of bed and take these pills. Then I'm able to get to sleep in the next fifteen to thirty minutes. Some nights I just take this along with my sleeping pills to give me a deeper sleep. When taking these natural sleep pills I find that I sleep through the night better. No waking up at odd hours of the night. I also notice I'm less anxious about sleeping when I take two pills. You are not supposed to take more than two. These do contain maltodextrin if that concerns you.

5,Powerful Antioxidant,Acai is great if you want to reduce your appetite. If you eat for pleasure then it might not work as well. I found that in two months of taking this supplement I didn't lose a great deal of weight (as reported in some reviews) but I did see dramatic results in the clarity and radiance of my skin. This supplement contains powerful antioxidants which protect the cells from free radicals. So if you are interested in skin health then I can recommend this to you. For me it hasn't helped me lose weight in a dramatic way as advertised in many blogs.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review,[],B000WNVJB4,B000WNVJB4,AGWDYYVVWM3DC3CASUZKXK67G6IA,2009-04-11 04:56:20.000,3,True,1107,"('POSITIVE', 0.998953104019165)",POSITIVE,0.998953104019165
5,My husband loves this lamp for reading,"The Verilux HappyEyes Floor lamp is an especially versatile light with numerous applications. It will brighten your entire desk while typing and is perfect to use while reading on the couch, in your favorite chair or basically anywhere you choose. Even while working on projects like knitting, puzzles or crafts, this light is very helpful. I bought this for my husband for Christmas and keep stealing it while I'm reviewing.<br /><br />This makes a perfect gift for anyone who loves to read. My husband loves it because it makes maps look especially bright and clear. He says the colors stand out more and I love the way it brings out the text in books. If you don't want to move this from room to room (although it is not too heavy), buy two or one for each desk or one for the office and even the bedroom.<br /><br />I could use at least three of these around the house because I rarely stay in one room for very long. Some of the ways I've used this lamp is to see when reading, but you can also brighten a room by pointing the lamp at the ceiling. The super flexible arm allows the light to point in any direction. There are also two brightness levels so you can decide on the brightness you prefer.

5,The secret of this tea...,"Sweetening your tea with Stevia produces results so similar to sugar, you won't miss sugar in your tea. Before trying the tea bags, I always used to buy the little packets of stevia and still intend to use them in the future. My thought was that this would be an easy way to sweeten my tea along with the other tea bags I was already using and that would save time.<br /><br />Well, there are some interesting aspects to stevia tea that I had not considered. Firstly, when adding a stevia tea bag, the results are ""super sweet"" if you leave the tea bag in the cup or teapot for the entire time you are steeping the tea. The result is a bit overwhelming and seems to produce a very earthy tea.<br /><br />For the best results - if you enjoy a mildly sweet tea - is to add the tea bag at the end or when you are adding in milk or milk powder. By stirring in one of these stevia tea bags, you can sweeten the tea to taste.<br /><br />The Stevia in these tea bags is from Paraguay. If you want to use this as a regular tea, it is very sweet and you may want to add other ingredients like lemon juice or mint.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",[],B000EQ2X0U,B000EQ2X0U,AGWDYYVVWM3DC3CASUZKXK67G6IA,2007-01-26 18:23:38.000,1,False,1109,"('POSITIVE', 0.9973611235618591)",POSITIVE,0.9973611235618591

Distilled sterile water is recommended and you can buy it in the grocery store.<br /><br />2. If you are unfamiliar with the proper technique for using a Neti Pot there are many instructional videos on YouTube. This should be a safe and relatively comfortable experience.<br /><br />3. Clean the NetiPot after every use. and let air dry.<br /><br />Please follow ollow the instructions and read recommendations on the FDA's website to ensure safe use and you're good to go.<br /><br />** If you found this review to be helpful at all, please take a moment and click the button below to let Amazon know.

4,"Vesitile, adjustable, and soothing support for hip and sacroiliac pain","I am truly impressed with the Sui Song, Sacroiliac Support Belt because it is is one of the most versatile and adjustable support braces I have tried. Over the years, I have had many sports injuries and the issues that occur naturally with age. This belt can be used for comforting support of any number of areas from the lower back, sciatic nerve to hip injuries, including the sacroiliac, which is a very difficult area to support.  The velcro is covered with a protective fleece strip, so be sure to remove it, or you will think it's the worst Velcro ever. LOL. Yes, it took me a minute to discover that because most manufacturers don't bother to protect the Velcro. The overall quality is excellent, and this belt can be adjusted to find the sweet spot of soothing relief. With all of my injuries, I would consider myself the queen of pain, and this is one of the best support belts I have found so far, There is nothing else like it, and I highly recommend it for those difficult to treat areas. Now, if I could only find something this good for my shoulder, I would be in heaven!<br />** If you found this review to be helpful at all, please take a moment and click the button below to let Amazon know.

I don't mind that they're not included, as I'd rather spend the money on good quality alkalines or rechargeables. But I can see where not having batteries to get you started would be a bummer. Likewise, I'm not really disappointed that a charger isn't included, especially at this price point.<br /><br />Those little inconveniences aside, the unit works incredibly well. It's easy to know the direction when placing the cuff on. The user guide is well written; it was easy to follow the step by step instructions. Even though I could see the results on the large LCD screen, it was to have the voice prompts let me know my results. I see this as a great benefit to elderly people who may have a little trouble reading the screen. And you can save your results to memory, for 2 separate users, to recall at a later date.

4,My experience was different from the 1st 2 reviewers.,"I picked up a bottle at a teacher's training in upstate NY and I thoroughly enjoyed the drink! So much so that I saved the bottle to buy on Amazon once I return home to Boston. Little did I know that what I scanned into Amazon came up a different looking bottle. Same product, different look.<br /><br />I'm the sure the 2 reviews before me had a horrible experience, but I really REALLY liked the taste of the mineral greens. My bottle of the drink tasted similar to golden milk aka Tumeric Milk with a touch of greens.<br /><br />It seems that the different bottles taste different. I sure hope that someone on Amazon will choose to sell the Mineral Greens that come in the bottle that I was introduced to.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ZDHA0ZbXL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ZDHA0ZbXL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ZDHA0ZbXL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B015DA9I6I,B015DA9I6I,AEXT7WUOKJ3IFWSTLQJAXOBPW5RQ,2016-08-23 15:06:37.000,0,False,1466,"('POSITIVE', 0.9982931017875671)",POSITIVE,0.9982931017875671

4,A real review by Bigdeal,"I was not compensated in any way for the review of this product. I suffer from joint damage in both knees therefore I need a rise in my toilet seat so I can easily get up and down. Guests to my home that do not have bad knees also state how much they like having the extra boost on the toilet. I had a different brand of toilet seat booster prior to this that had a much more comfortable seating portion,it was wider and was made of a better feeling plastic however after about two years of use the locking mechanism on that seat failed. This new seat is made of a  harder plastic that is not as comfortable and the width is not as generous  however the side screw is on the backside rather than the front side and the seat is much more secure, there is no wobble once that seat is fully screwed in. The screws are very easy to adjust with large wing nut typed screws that are also me made of plastic. That being said I do believe it will give me a good two years of use. I would recommend this product one star deducted for for the narrowness of the seat.",[],B00WT3EUX4,B00WT3EUX4,AHXHTDLQBGEXW3L3OOZQI677KTAA,2016-04-15 18:30:28.000,12,True,1468,"('NEGATIVE', 0.9970889687538147)",NEGATIVE,0.9970889687538147

1,New update. Not happy.,"Update 2/19/21- so the green one is good. We found the orange one in a sheet in the closet. It had only been used a few times. My husband forgets to look good when we wash sheets. I found the orange one and for some reason it's dried out. The green one isn't dried and I've used it a lot. I'll stick to ordering the ones from Walmart. My husband said that's how it looked the day he took it out of washer and dryer. The pic I took doesn't really do justice but it's dark, cracked and dried. Feels like a dog biscuit in my hand. I've used the green one more and it's still green, sticky and works well.<br /><br />Old review-These really work at getting the hair off. Only thing I can say is that it is hard to collect the hair off of it before you want to throw them into a new load of dirty clothes because it's so tacky/sticky. Wet it and pull off the hair or get a hair roller to collect any debris off them while dry. It also will stick to the wall of washinging machine or dryer. I'm not sure if they really get a chance to tumble through the clothes before it clings on to the walls of machine. No instructions came with or the usual packaging. The ones I have been using can be put in washer and dryer. So far I can do the same with these.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/D1H4qWFOdJS._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/D1H4qWFOdJS._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/D1H4qWFOdJS._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08K43BL7W,B08K43BL7W,AFSBMDUHEGUSOBVSUMNQJG6NIX4A,2020-12-13 17:49:26.096,0,True,1478,"('NEGATIVE', 0.9949482679367065)",NEGATIVE,0.9949482679367065

4,Great little Ozone Generator,"This tobelife CW001 Mini Ozone Generator O3 Air Purifier works really well in small spaces.  It doesn't generate too much ozone as a lot of them do. It's rechargeable and the battery last a good long time.  It works great for my car and gym bag but has trouble with a mid sized room.  My only real complaint is they say to mount it high for best results in the instructions but only give you a very short USB cord.  Where I mounted it is hard to get to so I had to run a USB extension cable.<br /><br />Regardless, it's much better portable and in the car so I will be ordering a couple more for my locker, gym bag and car.  This is perfect for those uses.  I still want to see if it does anything in my workshop where it's mounted in the pictures.

When I travel and am in a secured place it's nice to be able to block out all the noise and get some good rest.  These did an excellent job.  I also used them when going to the shooting range and they worked great there also.  Having the different sizes meant I had an extra pair to give to someone that didn't have proper ear protection at the range. The hard carrying case is great to have as well or I would've lost them a long time ago.<br /><br />To be noise cancelling they would have to produce a counter noise, so the use of that term is incorrect but they do block out a good amount of sound.

4,great for hard to reach back area,"☀ i received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review. i was not influenced by anyone in any way.<br /><br />What I like most about this product is the long handle it has. I have issues with my arms. It hurts pretty bad when I'm trying to reach the middle of my back. This bath brush sure comes in handy for reaching that hard to reach area of my back. I use the small brush for my feet. Boy does that give a good massage on my feet. What a nice free gift that is added in. Then you can take the long handle off with ease and just use the bath brush to wash the rest of your body. Simple and easy as that.<br /><br />The box was damaged upon arrival. It was not by carrier because it was inside of a bigger box. But I would not discount. I just wanted to mention because my images shows the box and it's a little damaged at the end.<br /><br />You have the exfoliating body scrubber that you can choose from three different levels of scrubbing. Then massage out those toxins with it's built in massage therapy. As I get older, I find myself needing more of these items. Overall, these are nice, I don't really have any complaints as of now.

1,Do not waste your money!,"I had previously left a 3 star review since I was able to get a smooth shave the first time I used it. I've always had trouble shaving intimate areas because of razor burn and ingrown hairs. I was very hesitant in purchasing this product because I've tried countless shavers, epilators, razors, you name it - I've probably tried it!<br />I used this product ONE TIME and it was pretty cool that you use it wet, so I decided to try it out in the bathtub. It shaved very well, even though it was rather difficult reaching some places. Now, the aloe strips helped tremendously and I was quite pleased with the results. HOWEVER, after using this one time, the aloe strips were ruined and I couldn't use the shaver again because it caused horrible razor burn and didn't get nearly as close of a shave as before. There also isn't an option to purchase more aloe strips without having to buy a whole replacement head. I contacted customer service and sent pictures of the aloe strips and explained the situation. Long story short, they offered half my money back so I'd be stuck with a shaver I can't use and half of a refund - NO THANK YOU! I ended up returning the item.

I personally am using mine in my car (Dodge Durango) for comfort. I find that is is quite comfortable but I wish it was a little bit bigger.

4,High quality glasses but the lenses are not yellow tinted,"These are high quality glasses, well made, frame has rounded edges which makes it easier on the user.  Professionally enclosed in its own zipped box.<br /><br />However the lenses aren't really tinted yellow.  A slight faint hint of yellowish and that's all, just as pictured.  Therefore the UV protection is minimal, and I can view the blue light for example, on my USB hub clearly.  By comparison, my Uvex glasses (not readers) with distinct yellow tinted lenses block most of blue light so when I'm looking on the power button on my laptop wearing Uvex, I don't see it as blue.<br /><br />I was hoping that having these readers will allow me to eliminate Uvex but no such luck.  For now am stuck with having to wear both at the same time, and this is no fun plus more pressure on the ears, let alone having to constantly readjust.  But will keep the readers and will have to pay a visit to a local optometrist to have the lenses replaced with the yellow tinted ones.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51S7Zql6X-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51S7Zql6X-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51S7Zql6X-L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51uI9z4veLL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51uI9z4veLL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51uI9z4veLL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07C4NBKHG,B07C4NBKHG,AFMUPY7MX4JDJABC65AQM2ZN7HOA,2019-01-02 14:26:54.489,2,True,1603,"('NEGATIVE', 0.9948150515556335)",NEGATIVE,0.9948150515556335

4,Comfortable fit and good sound reduction,"I realize that the seller, in all honesty, advertises these earplugs as being disposable. That is, the seller recommends that the buyer use these ear plugs once only, and then throw them away. This is a fairly expensive way to use earplugs, and also rather inconvenient, because it means you need to keep regularly purchasing more of them. Personally, I have found, as is the case for other foam ear plugs I have used over the years, that these ear plugs can be washed and reused multiple times before they start to crack. Only then, in my opinion, is it truly necessary to discard them. I have attached a photo to show what it looks like when they crack.<br /><br />I make it a point, when washing these ear plugs with soap and water, to rinse them well, then pat and squeeze them thoroughly with a towel and let them air dry for at least 24 hours before using them again.<br /><br />Unlike other similar quality earplugs I own, when I wash these, they expand and get bigger. Fortunately, though, they don't seem to fit any tighter or more uncomfortably because of that expansion. I have attached a photo with a picture of one of these earplugs when new side-by-side with one that has been washed, as well as two other brands of earplugs I use that do not expand at all when washed and last a whole lot longer than these do over time.<br /><br />These aren't the least expensive ear plugs I have ever purchased, but they are reasonably priced for what is on offer.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/818nxyalL8L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/818nxyalL8L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/818nxyalL8L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ZA9mD2HGL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ZA9mD2HGL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ZA9mD2HGL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07PWQLKDC,B07PWQLKDC,AHW7ETGBKGX6DCG2LBAG5YAXU46A,2021-01-08 03:05:01.053,2,False,1660,"('NEGATIVE', 0.7671187520027161)",NEGATIVE,0.7671187520027161
5,"Its thin, sharp blade works very well!","I have owned many different pill cutters over the years, and this is the best one I’ve ever used, by far. It is constructed of medical-grade, BPA-free plastic, and its stainless-steel blade is thin and sharp. This allows it to cut pills in half without turning them into crumbs and dust, which happens all too often when such blades are too wide and too dull.<br /><br />It is typical for pill cutters to have a V-shape for holding pills of various sizes in place, so that is not in itself a unique feature. However, what is a new feature, to me at least, is that this pill cutter provides a highly visible, painted line running down the center of the V space. This mark allows the user to accurately position pills which contain an indented, break line in their center, such that this break line is in alignment with the cutter’s blade. This makes it additionally likely that this particular type of pill will be split cleanly in half, with no wasted crumbs.<br /><br />This pill cutter is conveniently larger than any other pill cutter I’ve owned, which are usually about 1-inch x 2.5-inch in size. This one is 1.5-inch x 3.5-inch, making it easier to handle for anyone who suffers from arthritis.<br /><br />Finally, as an extra little plus, this handy device is surprisingly attractive due to its sleek design and the fact that it is a pleasing, aqua color.<br /><br />All in all, I find this to be an excellent product that I would not hesitate to recommend to family or friends.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/817PyOdDVFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/817PyOdDVFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/817PyOdDVFL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B085TFQ8C9,B085TFQ8C9,AHW7ETGBKGX6DCG2LBAG5YAXU46A,2020-07-12 06:17:00.933,2,False,1661,"('POSITIVE', 0.9979361295700073)",POSITIVE,0.9979361295700073

It could have been done with two pair of pliers though. Once adjusted it simply lifts out of place when someone else needs to drive the vehicle and is easily returned to position when I am ready to drive again.<br />It was only a short learning curve until I was completely comfortable driving with it.<br />It was the only left foot gas pedal accessory that I found that didn't have to be bolted to the floor.<br />The bad.<br />After only two months the glue that held the plastic base that has the spikes that hold it secure in place by engaging the vehicles carpet, completely let go as shown in the pics. I would return it but for two reasons, I don't want to be without it and I am afraid that the glue on the new one will give out in two more months.<br />This is a potentially dangerous problem and you should be watching for it if you already have one or intend to buy one.<br />Conclusion.<br />I am not saying that you should not buy one but you should be aware of this fatal flaw and be aware that you may have to re-glue it. Furthermore, for $300, there should be some thought at the manufacturers level as to how to fix this serious problem.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61+Fui5iNcL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61+Fui5iNcL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61+Fui5iNcL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61tEgRGunRL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61tEgRGunRL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61tEgRGunRL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07L4YXPSQ,B07L4YXPSQ,AEYDL6XGKZ3VWTV5EJOO3I7ZC5IA,2021-09-28 15:46:31.711,1,True,1718,"('NEGATIVE', 0.9829718470573425)",NEGATIVE,0.9829718470573425

I was even more impressed when I moved around and discovered that these did not even attempt to slide down.  The over all fit was, well let's just say 'snug'.

The outer portion isn't squishy, it's sort of a sandy grip, which isn't a bad thing either. The trouble is that you need to attach this using a tiny allen wrench to tension the grip onto the pencil, which means that you have to have the wrench out EVERY TIME THE PENCIL NEEDS SHARPENING. My boys mash their pencils into the paper, resulting in many broken pencil tips. The allen wrench never gets put away, greatly increasing the likelihood that it'll be lost. There has to be a better way to make this grip adhere to the pencil, but other than that, it's a great device for helping kids that need this kind of aid.<br /><br />******BE ADVISED********<br /><br />This listing was not for the kit, I only purchase (as per the listing) the delux grip third from the top.

So I'm giving a (cautious) thumbs up for this because I've been using it with great success on an inflamed muscle in my leg.  I didn't expect it to work this well; I tried it because when I test a product I put it through all sorts of paces.<br /><br />What I found was that within about 5 minutes of application, the pain in my leg and backside had eased considerably.  It didn't go away entirely, that required the addition of some NSAIDs. But it did make the discomfort manageable, which is a blessing.  When I tried this as a sleep aid, it did nothing for me.  Results on a headache were mixed.  I will say that some advice I was given - always look for hemp products that are CO2 extracted - was good advice because I find such products to be across-the-boards more effective than any others.<br /><br />What can I take away from these experiments? Mostly what I take from most such experiments: We are all different, and products like this, which are created without set standards, will inevitably vary.

I can't say this is a must-have product, but it is a good product for people who don't have anything to wash their face with but water. The sponge will help exfoliate the skin without any exfoliates so it's natural and safe for all kinds of skin. You can use it with or without soap.

5,Best skin product I've ever used,"I'm a 60 year old woman who has been fighting against extreme oily skin, acne and large pores since my teens. This product has absolutely changed my life.  I've been using it for six weeks. My skin is clear and radiant in a way it has NEVER been before. I am able to go without makeup now with no embarrassment about red, oily, blemished skin. I honestly didn't think that would ever be possible for me.<br /><br />The first week I used it, I diluted it 50% with witch hazel because of the way it made my skin burn and tingle. Since then I've been using it full strength morning and evening, every day. Sometimes I use it at noon if my nose and chin start feeling oily. During the first week a few pimples emerged, I think my skin was purging submerged problems. However those pimples healed incredibly fast.  The spots on my face from old healed pimples have completely disappeared. I no longer have huge greasy pores to contend with. My skin is soft and smooth and radiant. If I feel a pimple start to show up, it heals before it actually gives me a problem!<br /><br />This does sometimes make my skin burn/tingle rather unpleasantly, but it's only for a couple of minutes before that subsides. It's well worth the momentary discomfort!  Worth mentioning is that even when it feels irritated, I've never experienced any redness from using it (which I do with many other products). It doesn't make my skin dry and there has been no peeling for me.  It does burn unpleasantly if you get it on your lips, so I like to apply lip balm before using it.<br /><br />This is a superb product and an answer to prayers for me.

3,Small ear loops,"I like the style of KF94 masks, they fit my face the best and are comfortable for me to wear all day, if necessary. These masks are made in China. They are individually wrapped in plastic bags, which I prefer. I keep backup masks in my car and bag, and this way I know the masks are clean until I need to use one.<br /><br />These masks have smaller ear loops than other KF94 masks I have used. For me, the smaller ear loops are good -- I have a petite face, and the small ear loops help me get a tight fit over my cheeks and chin. If you have a larger face, the small ear loops might not be a positive.<br /><br />The masks have the expected nose clip, but above the nose clip, the masks have a V-shaped cutout. In theory, the V-shaped cutout should help the top of the mask fit better against the sides of your nose, since it’s not a straight line like most masks. But for me, the sides of the cutout stand away from my nose, so they’re right at the bottom of my view. And I worry they are a spot for air to slide in and out of the mask, since they aren’t tight against my face.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41ChZxl4mxL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41ChZxl4mxL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41ChZxl4mxL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09QMNFT9S,B09QMNFT9S,AFVV7CLXY43P3Z3F7SROBZATZVSQ,2022-03-10 23:21:09.167,0,False,1965,"('POSITIVE', 0.5926850438117981)",POSITIVE,0.5926850438117981

However, the cut of the masks does keep them in place over my nose without the need for the nose wire. The masks also go under my chin.<br /><br />They pass the candle test. The masks have three layers of fabric even without a filter in place: the outer layer with the nebula print, a white lining, and the filter pocket. The filter pocket is open on both sides.<br /><br />At the longest point, the masks are about 10-10.5 inches. The widest point, from nose to chin, is about 5-5.5 inches.

The two elastic straps hold it tight against my palm or the back of my hand. The white plastic board, between the black foam and the microfiber sponge, holds the sponge firm while cleaning various surfaces.<br /><br />The microfiber sponge itself is thick and looks well-constructed. According to the instructions, the sponge is machine washable.<br /><br />The wiper works pretty well on windshields, removing streaks. It’s certainly a lot easier to get the awkward spot right by the dashboard (works best to take it off your hand and hold an edge for that area).<br /><br />The instructions say to use DRY, but I had the best results using glass cleaner on the windows.

The massager has a velcro strap on the back, so that it can be put around a headrest. But the strap is a little short for some office chairs. I have a gaming chair and the strap is too short to fasten if I want to put the pillow at the base or middle of the chair. So if you have a chair with a wide back, the strap might not reach.<br /><br />The back massage pillow has a heat option. I personally wish the pillow got hotter. I can barely feel the heat through a shirt. Higher heat, or even heat levels, would help relax my muscles more.<br /><br />Otherwise, I like this massager pillow a lot. I like that I can leave it on my chair and plug it in whenever I need to work tension out of my neck, shoulders, and back. There are three levels of kneading power, and the flap on top can be removed or left in place.

4,Very fizzy! But almost no scent.,"This set of 12 bath bombs from MCleanPin is made in China. The back of the box lists the ingredients: sodium sulfate, tartaric acid, deep sea mud, citric acid, sorbitol, mineral oil, plant essence.<br /><br />The bath bombs aren’t labeled with their scents. I wish they were, because I don’t want to look up the product photos every time I want to use one. Some of the colors match, like the white bath bomb for Milk, but I could also see that one being Vanilla (Vanilla is actually blue and purple).<br /><br />Performance wise, I was quite impressed with the fizziness of the bath bombs. They fizzed and floated around the tub for more than 5 minutes! I didn’t expect that, since the bath bombs are on the smaller side.<br /><br />I tried the Cananga bath bomb first, because it’s blue, and I figured that would be the most likely color to stain me or the tub. The bath bomb turned the water a vibrant blue, with a few little specks of gold glitter. Happily, there was no blue residue left on my skin or the tub afterwards. There was a slight gritty feeling in the water as the bath bomb did its thing, but once it was done fizzing, I didn’t notice that any longer.<br /><br />The bath bomb had no fragrance. The whole box of 12 has a slight scent, but on their own, I couldn’t smell anything. I didn’t pick up orange from the Orange bath bomb, or rose from the Rose bath bomb.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/612CIUDjFEL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/612CIUDjFEL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/612CIUDjFEL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/617l8isARWL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/617l8isARWL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/617l8isARWL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B086D3HDPR,B086D3HDPR,AFVV7CLXY43P3Z3F7SROBZATZVSQ,2020-07-02 23:49:11.265,0,False,1969,"('NEGATIVE', 0.6481057405471802)",NEGATIVE,0.6481057405471802
3,"Do not fizz, but do color the water","I wish the labels for the Scented Candle Bath Bombs included the fragrance(s), rather than just “Lucky You” or “Princess” or “To Life!” Since the bath bombs are described as “aromatherapy candles and bath bombs,” the scent is clearly a big part of Purelis’s intentions.<br /><br />But I couldn’t make out any of the scents. I tried “Passion,” since I figured if any color would stain me or the tub, it would be the deep green bath bomb. Did the scent evoke passion for me? Nope. I have no idea what it was supposed to smell like. It didn’t smell bad, but my nose was clueless.<br /><br />The bath bomb didn’t fizz at all.

5,works!,"I chose these for their touted ""cholesterol lowering"" properties.  I am aware that eating cholesterol does not cause cholesterol.  I am aware that eating saturated fat does not cause cholesterol.  I know that inflammation causes cholesterol and any other school of thought is like blaming the bandaid for what the boxcutter did.<br /><br />That said ... because I have a mast cell disorder my body seems to rebel on me and causes high cholesterol.  The first time is was 363 high and I lowered it to 217 by eliminating dairy only.  This was on the recommendation of a nutritionist. We were already on a clean keto ... so no added sugars or grains or other inflammatory foods.  In MY body however, even though I am not allergic to dairy, or intolerant, or 'sensitive"" on tests, my body doesn't like it.<br /><br />So ... I again popped a 288 cholesterol 3 weeks ago.  LDL was high and everything else good.  I told my doc I could lower it with dietary changes.  He said sure why not.  So ... about 3 weeks ago I cut out all dairy except butter & heavy cream (which are mostly fat), and added in Citrus Bergamot.  I checked my cholesterol last week and I was 204, which to me is great and I am happy with that.  But I have continued taking this supplement and keeping dairy out (because my pain had gone way down and my energy way up)  I also ended up taking almonds out too because they were making my lip swell and throat sore (again mast cell disorder).  I took my cholesterol today and it was 114.  Is it a fluke?  An outlier?  No idea.  I will get it tested at a lab in a few weeks and I will update my review.<br /><br />But I will say, this supplement seems to makes a difference, coupled with a proper diet low in inflammatory sugars and things that spike insulin and I believe this is a winner.  I would recommend it.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/819skz6Mj4L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/819skz6Mj4L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/819skz6Mj4L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81KNuPgV2UL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81KNuPgV2UL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81KNuPgV2UL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81NxeP4oc9L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81NxeP4oc9L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81NxeP4oc9L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08N59VFL6,B08N59VFL6,AEF4QCBYMXQN3RDFNM4ZXM67UTJA,2021-05-01 22:07:00.151,3,False,1997,"('POSITIVE', 0.6030401587486267)",POSITIVE,0.6030401587486267

I will admit upfront, I *purchased this free to review* it.<br /><br />I do not end up purchasing everything I am offered, I do not believe in purchasing things, or taking things I will not use.  This, however, was intriguing to me.  I have long hair that is past my waist and I already use hair straighteners and curling wands.

I didn't feel uncomfortable at all peeling off the outer bark and chewing on the stick. It does have a flavor which is sort of indescribable, but bits can come off in your mouth and they are much like shredded coconut. Anyway, after softening and chewing the tip in your mouth by gently chewing on it, the fibers fan out to form a brush. While the stick is long, it's impossible to get the inside of your teeth, but as you use it up it's easier to get your hand in there.<br /><br />So, I wouldn't use these as a replacement for my toothbrush, but they are a wonderful accompaniment. My teeth feel great after using it. It brushes all the plaque away and leaves you feeling super clean but without any mint. Each stick lasts quite a while because you only use half an inch each time, and then use a scissors to snip off the used part so that it remains sanitary.<br /><br />If you've never tried these, all I can say is that my experience was pretty good and I would definitely recommend them.

4,For Your Finest Finery,"This product smells wonderful. Oddly, as you can see, the label claims it to be unscented, and the listing claims it to be scented. I believe it might be mislabeled, but it doesn't matter because this product is very good. You spritz it on to the stain and work it into the fabric. After letting it sit for a couple of minutes, run water through the fabric or blot with a wet cloth.<br />I found that with most stains I had to do that twice, but on the good side it's clear that this is safe for a lot of hand washables, as long as you are gentle and don't rub the stain too hard.<br /><br />I've had those big commercial brands of stain removers make things worse by fading the area that you spray them in. That was not the case with this product. It might not be as effective, but it's not going to damage your clothes. If you have something delicate and/or your clothes are a huge investment, invest in this product as well.<br />Another plus is that the 2 oz spray is good for travel.<br /><br />So, this might be a product that you need, or another one might be best for you.

5,Beauty and More!,"Right off the bat, when tasting this, I was rejoicing that it wasn't too sweet. Many products of this nature have stevia or monk fruit, which not only have an aftertaste, but they use so much that the sweetness is cloying.<br />Not only is this product not super sweet, but it has just a little sweetness that occurs naturally from the organic berry powders.<br />And speaking of berries, what a powerhouse! In addition to beets and chaga mushrooms, you have the superfruit goji, maqui, and acai.<br />Since berries are on the hot list of being highly contaminated with pesticides, this is a product you can feel great about because all but the collagen peptides are organic.<br /><br />I love that I can just sprinkle it into my yogurt or oatmeal, as well as mixing it with a liquid. It tastes slightly sweet, slightly earthy. It gives a nice flavor to unsweetened yogurt especially if it's sprinkled with nuts. Perfect healthy breakfast.<br />And only 25 calories for a tablespoon!<br />The formulation is geared for beauty, and by now we all know the benefit of collagen when it comes to skin. But this is so much more than just skin loving, I feel that it's an all-around health tonic.<br />Definitely will be getting more when this canister is done.<br /><br />Update: So, I think I have found a breakfast nirvana. English muffin with cherry preserves, and  this powder sprinkled on top. So darn good I go to sleep happy, knowing I'm going to have this fantastic breakfast in the morning!<br />As another update, since taking this regularly, I feel that I have more energy and my mood is elevated.

4,"Good Flavor, Great Packaging","Unlike the plastic tubs, this canister looks good on the counter. Yes, that matters to me. Of course, what matters most is what's inside.<br />In addition to type 1 and 3 collagen, there is whey and instant whole milk powder, which helps boost the protein to a nice 20 g.<br />The chocolate tastes high quality, but then it's ruined by too much monk fruit extract as a sweetener. At least for me. I know a lot of people will appreciate the sweetness because this is a product you can mix in just water. As an aside, personally I'd rather not have the oft used stevia either. If they insist on it being sweet, a bit of organic sugar would make it taste more natural, and I wouldn't mind the extra calories.<br /> It makes a very nice hot cocoa type of beverage. Even in water, it tastes creamy.<br />Another thing I like is that there is no plastic scoop hiding under the powder. Thumbs up for friendlier packaging.<br />Something else to like is the bottom of the canister which has both the date of manufacturer as well as expiration date.

I feel like the warm humidifier is more effective with opening up nasal passages. The size is pretty convenient would fit nicely on a nightstand and hold enough water (half gallon) to run for 13 hours. Mine came looking used because there were several dirty looking spots on it (pictures). I filled it up today because my daughter is currently sick with what sounds like croup. You simple unscrew the bottom of the tank and fill it up (I noticed there is no line that says the max) so i filled it up to the brand name. It took a couple minutes to warm up and then it started to shoot out the warm (kinda hot) vapor. There is only one button so it's very easy to operate- the button gives you 3 different options: low, high, or off. I love the tray feature for the essential oil vapor that and the warm air are the main reasons why I decided to get it! It's also pretty quiet, just kind of sounds like a very low heater fan.

I decided to go with this product because it came with a book, an outlet tester, the grounding cord, and because the mat looked comfortable.<br /><br />The first 2 nights I used it, I actually kept waking up and didn't sleep through the night which is not something i normally do. I am not sure if that's a coincidence or if the mat had something to do with it?<br /><br />So in my bed i have my fiance, my 5 year old, and myself so I have the mat spread out and centered on the bed horizontally so we could all lay on it.<br /><br />The grounding connector on my mat is located on the top silver part that you are suppose to lay on, which gets a little bit uncomfortable having to lay on the cord. I wish it came with it attached underneath (like it is shown in the pictures)<br />This also makes it more likely to knock the grounding wiring completely off while sleeping.

2,Not one size fits most!,"These are listed as one size fits most. My thoughts on that were that that meant fits a lot of different sizes. Not. I wear a 14 and there way no way these were going on. I gave them to my oldest daughter, who wears an 8, and they barely fit. Not only were they difficult for her to get on in the first place, they kept sliding down, over time. The waistband doesn't hold them up very good and, with the thighs being so extremely tight, they kept wanting to work their way down. To be fair, they seem nice and warm. However, I wouldn't recommend these for anyone over a size 8 (AT MAX!) or, probably, under a size 6(?) maybe a 4 (?). Not my idea of ""one size fits most"".<br /><br />1 star - Awful!

It does not dry fast though, so it's best to apply in the evening when all the chores are done. It has a very soothing effect on skin. I recommend it as a first quick relief treatment. Active ingredients are Lanolin 15.5% and Petrolatum 53.4%. You need to make sure you are do not have adverse reaction to them.

3,Okay teeth whitening kit,"While it didn't miraculously make my teeth as white as snow, it did make them a bit lighter. The instructions it comes with leave much to be desired. They are very vague. It comes with whitening strips packets, the light machine and silicone teeth mold. First thing to do, you have to open the battery holder. There is a paper disk between two flat batteries to prevent them from running out since the button on the top is so sensitive, small accidental touch will turn it on.<br /><br />The strips come in two sizes - short and long. I tried both sizes on both sets of teeth and determined that longer goes on the top teeth and the short one goes on the lower teeth. It would have been nice to have it confirmed in the instructions. The whitening cycle times vary from 30-45 minutes with the requirement not to eat or drink one hour afterwards. The whitening light machine shuts off every 10 minutes on the dot, as if to remind not to leave it in too long. First time my teeth felt tingly and slightly cool, but then nothing out of ordinary happened. Since it has to stay put in there for a while, the saliva that collects behind the teeth has to go somewhere. I swallowed it. It was not overly unpleasant with slight traces of something. It's ok whitening kit, but it does not perform miracle.",[],B07Z9V4YQH,B07Z9V4YQH,AGDJ4U4GGIQ6AJLIBE6RSDPL2VYA,2020-03-01 20:07:08.731,0,False,2168,"('NEGATIVE', 0.9968001842498779)",NEGATIVE,0.9968001842498779

5,Fantastic Product,"I have been fermenting my own vegetables for some time now. I have tried various methods and recipes. I would not consider making fermented vegetables without this product.<br /><br />I use 1 tablespoon of Himalayan Pink Salt per head of cabbage, 1 packet of Body Ecology Vegetable Starter, 1 rounded teaspoon of organic honey (locally purchased from our bee-keeper).  I put these ingredients into my Vita Mix with some of the vegetables and I pulverize it using pure Alkaline water. I then put the brine on the shredded vegetables and stir well. I add additional water if needed. I use different amounts of salt but not on the other ingredients. Just one packet of starter, etc. is enough.<br /><br />I then pack the vegetables into a German crock (purchased here on Amazon) and I pack them down using a potato masher.  When the pot is packed, I add whole cabbage leaves to place on top to keep small pieces of vegetables from floating. I add the stones that came with the Crock on top of the leaves. I push them down with the potato masher and make sure that the water rises above the stones.<br /><br />I then leave this for 7 days at room temperature.  When fermented, I place the vegetables in mason jars and store in my refrigerator. I eat these vegetables daily. I like them with scrambled eggs for breakfast or a nice piece of meat for dinner as a side dish.<br /><br />I am always making fermented vegetables. My favorite is organic green cabbage and carrots. But you can use almost any vegetable and add red pepper and garlic if desired. The choice is yours.

5,You'll be singing and skipping along like a joyous fool!,"I finally have to admit that I'm getting older and my feet hurt. When I wear boots in particular,  after a couple of hours in I have to take them off or sit down because the balls of my feet will burn and it's just uncomfortable.<br />I have some knee damage and I broke my foot a few years ago so these days even more than before, I am aware of how uncomfortable feet affect my mood,  my posture and my balance.<br />When you are not walking straight and even late  it can affect your hip and lower back as well . These insoles are an absolute godsend. In my pictures you'll see how much thicker they are near the balls of the feet than the ones you get at the store,  or even the custom ones I had made at a local store. Nothing beats these for comfort. The gel is thick and distributes evenly in such a way that I feel like I'm wearing my slippers all day.<br /> I live in South Texas, where boots are an absolute staple, in the summer or winter, and these insoles have made such a difference!<br />You will have to cut them down to size just like with most insoles that you buy at the store,  and since they are thicker than any others I have ever bought, I do need to wear thinner socks. But since boots (western ones, in particular) tend to be a little roomier,  these insoles work perfectly with them.<br />I don't know what negative ion technology is but I really don't need to know the details. All I need to know is that these will stay in my boots and I will replace them every six months as recommended because I've never been more comfortable in my boots! After wearing them the first day, my daughter borrowed them from me and put them in her shoes because she was planning on a long day at school and work. She too was amazed...at 23 years old she has discovered that gel insoles are not just for old ladies like her mom. :)<br />I never thought I'd be sitting here riding along review about my feet come on my boots or insoles, but here I am raving about my latest discovery! I can definitely recommend this to anyone.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71BWObvgBDL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71BWObvgBDL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71BWObvgBDL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71BWObvgBDL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71BWObvgBDL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71BWObvgBDL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/811H3xmjtVL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/811H3xmjtVL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/811H3xmjtVL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/811H3xmjtVL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/811H3xmjtVL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/811H3xmjtVL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81TB5e+a+7L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81TB5e+a+7L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81TB5e+a+7L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81TB5e+a+7L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81TB5e+a+7L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81TB5e+a+7L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01N76TF8X,B01N76TF8X,AFGYXDYK65D2LGTV3GJZJRFQC3HQ,2016-12-15 06:19:07.000,5,True,2288,"('POSITIVE', 0.581268846988678)",POSITIVE,0.581268846988678

All those years of wearing shoes that were so fashionable but crammed my toes together and did not give me good back support, well that's all catching up with me and as bunions have appeared, I have found the need for toe separators.

3,Looks great but hard to use,"I have used styling products my whole life but only started using a flat iron a few years ago.  I like that one and yet thought there might be something better, especially since I've been using the flat iron for both straightening and light waves of late.<br /><br />I love the sleek, all black look of this iron.  It's a little smaller/slimmer than my old one, and it has a nice long swivel cord.  It heats up super-quickly as promised, and the auto shutoff is a nice feature.  Unfortunately, the coloring of the temperature display makes it very difficult to read the numbers, especially as I am getting ready in the morning without my reading glasses.  (Note: you will have to press both the power button and the temp button at the same time to switch the temperature reading from C to F.)<br /><br />For straightening my hair, I found that the iron generally performed well.  I didn't really see any different between the floating plates of this iron and my old iron, but still, the iron worked well for my fine hair.  I had more trouble using this iron to create waves.  The sleek black case is aesthetically pleasing but has no real traction/grip, making it hard to twirl the iron for curling.  Although there are small grips at the end of the iron, these aren't tapered and don't work well at all.  Adding to the challenge is that the plates go all the way to the end, so when gripping the tips and trying to turn the iron, I burned myself several times.<br /><br />If you plan to use this iron for straightening only, it may work for you, but if you are looking for a more versatile styling product, I would not recommend this iron.",[],B07CYQ4KY3,B07CYQ4KY3,AFIJLAW3HIOMRUFSWNH54IJ3XQAA,2020-01-09 15:20:30.594,0,False,2342,"('NEGATIVE', 0.8358932137489319)",NEGATIVE,0.8358932137489319

4,"solid product, some issues but mileage may vary based on individual preference","There are some good things and less good about this, but the review comes with the caveat that sleep preferences are so individual that it's tough to say how much one's view should hold for someone else. But that said:<br /><br />1) Size:  the footprint is nice. It doesn't take up a lot of space; I'd call it medium size maybe leaning toward small. I've definitely seen many that were bigger, so you don't need a lot of space to use this<br /><br />2) lighting:  I'd prefer a dimmer light personally, thought the breath function and colors are nice. If you have this right near the bed, it's a bit too bright I'd say, but if it's obstructed or you're  not facing it than it isn't bad at all.<br /><br />3) volume:  volume control is good--I'm not sure why you'd want it loud (I guess if you have a lot of street noise), but it can get a decent volume on it<br /><br />4) sounds:  this was the more problematic issue for us. We just didn't find many of the sounds pleasurable or soothing. Some would have soothing parts, but then a loud surge of sound would appear, which would seem to defeat the purpose. We've heard others that were just more tranquil, soothing. some of that can be somewhat ameliorated by the volume control obviously, but still wasn't what we were expecting. There are a good number and variety, but honestly we'd only use 3, possibly 4. On the other hand, if you're looking for ""drown-out"" sound, you might find that less of an issue<br /><br />5) timer is good and works well. Never understood ones that came without them, so this is a good, I'd say required, touch<br /><br />It's a useful, solid product, but not quite as all-around useful as its numbers of lights/sounds might indicate.

3,Alexa-Like Voice But Button Responsiveness Weak and Some Crude Sounds,"The best part of this sound machine is that an Alexa-type voice speaks to you as you set the timer: ""15 minutes."" Press button. ""30 Minutes."" ""60 minutes"" etc. It has a soft foreign accent that I can't place but it's cute. Most sound machines don't have a human voice saying anything. I guess it's needed because there are no light buttons to tell you which setting you're choosing.<br /><br />Except for this, I felt this device feels cheaply made. The casing feels cheap (hard, brittle plastic) and the buttons on the interface are not sensitive to touch. You have to press really hard sometimes to get it to change settings. The volume control is also confusing - there are actually two volume controls - one to raise the volume, one to lower. I was pressing one volume control (the loud one) thinking that I could lower it but I was mistaken - you have to press the ""low volume"" button.<br /><br />On the positive side, the night light works well - the colors are neon bright and you can keep a steady color going all night long OR cycle through the different colors. The timer like I said has a human voice, which is kind of cool. The weak parts are the button responsiveness and some of the sounds. The lullaby function is good and the sound is sharp and clear. The Nature sounds are relatively good - the best are the chirping bird sounds and thunderstorm but the ""water"" sounds (i.e., ocean, babbling brook) sound muffled and are not particularly sharp. The ""white noise"" is also kind of indistinct and the ""fetal heartbeat"" sound is just plain crude - not so much a heartbeat but like someone else noted, it's like banging drums.<br /><br />So...it's a serviceable device but I would not pay too much for this.

I have both kinds of oil - the real unprocessed kind for massaging into my hair, hands and nails, and this kind, which is versatile but lacks the smell of coconut but is good as a ""carrier"" oil. Both have their uses and this product is of decent quality - I would just go by price because I don't see any discernible difference between this one and other similarly priced brands of fractionated oil.",[],B08N8N37ZQ,B08N8N37ZQ,AH3BXW7KLIS2VAE56UXJS2NS7I5A,2021-03-11 14:25:11.051,0,False,2376,"('POSITIVE', 0.9890900254249573)",POSITIVE,0.9890900254249573

The bag is reasonably sturdy, like a bag from a boutique, and the handles are decent.

5,Great Quality Gift Bags,"I almost wish someone I knew would have a birthday soon just to have an excuse to gift one of these bags! I ordered the ""all occasion"" bags with balloons and it was much better than pictured - the material is sturdy, better than your typical gift bag found at a 99 cent store and quite attractive. It doesn't say ""Happy Birthday"" but it seems the holiday best suited for using these bags, though the bag could also be used for promotions, graduation gifts, and anything celebratory.

I love how glittery they are and they come in a variety of colors - silver, gold, rose gold. I love how they look and they are ideal for gifting small items like jewelry.

They are not made of the usual thin paper and are meant to be re-used, not just thrown away after one use, making them environmentally friendly, which is a plus.<br /><br />The bags are on the small side, however, so they seem best suited for swag bags or intimate gifts of jewelry rather than large birthday or holiday presents. This impression is solidifed by the fact that the bags come with tags saying ""Thank You' on them. I wish there had been other tags included as well, like ""Seasons Greetings"" or ""Happy Birthday!""

I had to trim these to fit my sneakers but there was no helpful dotted lines to show me how to customize them.

They're meant to be disposable but only after you've used them a number of times. They look like paper towels but are thicker, with some of the durability of a rag. Yet, because they look like paper towels, it's fairly easy to toss them out accidentally after only one use if you forget. I know I did.<br /><br />These are good if you remember not to toss them out after one use - so I suppose they're no worse or better than rags, which you must toss out eventually.

It's convenient, however, to have both these items sold as one set as I normally use both when I'm cleaning pots and pans - the softer one reserved for lighter, easier to remove stains and the more abrasive steel pads for hardened grease or difficult to remove encrusted food remnants.

The toothpaste has a yellowish color and kind of reminds me of lemon filling. It leaves your mouth feeling fairly clean but there is a lightness to this toothpaste that other white and chalky toothpastes (like Crest) don't have.<br /><br />I question whether the lack of fluoride will be effective in the long-term at protecting my recessed gums and preventing plaque from taking hold. I usually use Colgate Total, so only time will tell if this toothpaste will be as effective. I have been brushing it now for only a week, so I will update this review if anything changes.

Opening the box I found a sonic toothbrush, usb charging cord, two brush heads, instructions, warranty card and an offer for two free brush heads. Charging was simple, just plug in to any usb charging device, plug the other end into the toothbrush and charging is completed in several hours. The three bar charging indicator let me know when it had a full charge. There are five modes of brushing: clean, sensitive, white, gum care and massage. Each has a different type of sonic rhythm and are fun to use. A full charge lasted well over two weeks. Each use of the Yasi toothbrush left my mouth, teeth and gums clean and invigorated. I really like the built-in timer with a momentary pause at 30, 60 and 90 seconds. The toothbrush stops after the recommended 2 minute brushing period.<br />Overall, the Yasi YS964 toothbrush far exceeds my expectations and is much better than my previous sonic toothbrush.

They are adjustable, I carefully bent them inward so they fit my face better and they did not break. I think I will order another set. I am terrible to leave my glasses around everywhere, and then &#34;where did I leave my glasses?&#34; is the question. I am giving all my others to the Salvation Army or friends if they want them.

5,A game changer,"When toilet paper became so scarce at the beginning of the pandemic, I ordered a bidet sprayer (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01E4H7DTA) to cut down on TP use. Then all I had to worry about was using just enough TP to dry off. Then I got these washable bamboo makeup removers that fit nicely in a little ceramic pot on the back of my toilet, and they work great for drying off. Not only that, when used with a low-sudsing feminine wash, I can wash my private parts as needed and cut down on how often I waste water bathing.<br /><br />For someone who is retired with little activity and very dry skin, there really is no need to bathe more than once a week as long as the privates are washed daily. I like that I can do this while sitting on the toilet and not risk a fall (I have osteoporosis) getting in and out of the tub. Besides, I hear a number of celebrities are now advocating not bathing very frequently, so I must be cool!<br /><br />I got two packs of 16 makeup removers each, and each pack comes with a nice mesh bag for washing the rounds in the washing machine. So I keep a bag beside the toilet to hold the ones I've used, and when the clean ones are all gone, I just start on the second pack while the other is in the wash. The little bit of soap left on each used round prevents it from getting groady until wash time.<br /><br />I'm very, very pleased with this product, and I'd give it an extra star if I could for the washing bag.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/719jUPZinUL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/719jUPZinUL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/719jUPZinUL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07P8BQ97L,B0B7RR3RCX,AELARKBAP6VKNL4D22ORELHTREBA,2021-12-29 21:04:47.179,6,True,2599,"('POSITIVE', 0.9517477750778198)",POSITIVE,0.9517477750778198

5,Dry brushing feels fantastic and has good health benefits,"I doubt I would use this body brush in the shower, because I think if it gets wet it's going to be more likely to lose bristles, but as a dry skin brush it is awesome! It's comfortable to hold, the handle wrapping ensures a good grip, and it's long enough to be able to reach your whole back or all the way down to your feet without being so huge it's unwieldy for doing your arms and front torso.<br /><br />If you've never tried dry brushing, you should. It's stimulating to your skin, helps remove dead flaky skin better than wet-showering does, and has a number of benefits for health. Google it! One thing dry brushing is good for is to help open up the skin to allow ingrown hairs (like I have on my legs from using an epilator) to surface.<br /><br />This brush, which I received at a discount in exchange for my honest review, will hang on the side of my vanity to remind me to pick it up and do a little dry brushing while I'm otherwise occupied...a great multitasking habit to get into.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71L5rZxJ6VL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71L5rZxJ6VL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71L5rZxJ6VL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71rn+4QRyAL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71rn+4QRyAL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71rn+4QRyAL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81LczIgIvIL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81LczIgIvIL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81LczIgIvIL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01FS7TJ9M,B01FS7TJ9M,AELARKBAP6VKNL4D22ORELHTREBA,2016-06-03 15:11:04.000,2,False,2601,"('POSITIVE', 0.9985866546630859)",POSITIVE,0.9985866546630859
5,"If you drink, you need to be taking a formulation like this","I confess: I probably drink more alcohol than I should. Sometimes none, sometimes more than advised. Can you relate? (I'm sorry, but American politics drives me to drink!) I'm pretty good at eating healthy for the most part, but I do confess I love gin. I took just a plain milk thistle capsule for years, and that seemed to give me some protection from the occasional (or not so occasional) indulgence, but when I ran out I stopped taking it. And I've noticed my liver goes through phases of not being happy and acting up. Just a bad feeling, a nagging almost-pain.<br /><br />When I was offered this Total Liver formulation at a discount in exchange for my honest review, I thought I'd try it because I knew I needed to get back on something to help protect my liver. It's got the milk thistle I know from past experiences is very effective, but it also has other ingredients that have been scientifically proven to help protect the liver. The best protection, of course, is not to overdo, but if you're going to be bad, this formulation is a good insurance policy.<br /><br />I did try to take less than the four-pills-a-day dosage, but I didn't see any improvement until I took it as recommended.

4,Get the right size and you will love these,"Darn, I got these in the wrong size, so DP gets to have them instead of me. I got a large, and I should have gotten them in a smaller size.

I need them, too, so I'm going to have to buy my own pair.<br /><br />Be sure to follow the instructions for measuring the size you need before ordering. Don't guess, like I did. (Actually, when I was offered a pair of these to review, I don't think they had the sizing instructions listed. I don't remember seeing them, anyway.) If you size them correctly, I think you'll be very pleased with the quality of the materials and the compression. I know DP is.<br /><br />UPDATE: I got a pair in the small for myself, and that's more like it! I have a tibial tuberosity on my right knee that tends to get very itchy if I walk a lot, which I'm doing now (about 3 miles a day), and these compression knee sleeves definitely help with that.

I wish the bristles where a little less soft. Sometimes I wonder if their teeth are really getting a good cleaning because the brush is so soft.  It's great to massage their gums.

This treatment does seem to freshen them a bit, nothing miraculous since I keep mine very clean but I use it weekly or as a last resort if one contact is really bugging me to see if it's salvageable or ready to toss.

I've already been down to my last one and it had snapped twice leaving me with about 5 inches of length and it was fraying before my eyes as I tried to finish my last tusk.<br /><br />They cut through tusks and casts beautifully.

This is the first time I've tried a heating pad that has Jade tourmaline, but it seems to give it a more even, and hot heat.  <br />It does take a little while longer for it to heat up than a regular heating pad, but there's no way I could use it turned on the highest setting, as it gets so very hot. The heating pad material is quite stiff and just does not feel very nice against my skin. It would be quite hard to wrap around your shoulder or any other part of your body, as it is not very flexible. I even find it a bit uncomfortable leaning back on it, when sitting on my sofa.<br />When turned on, it smells quite strongly of wires or chemicals burning.

I know some people go to sleep with a heating pad on, but I would not feel safe leaving this one on without it being looked after. The smell bothered me so bad, I actually stopped using it, for fear that there is a short in it somewhere.<br />Though I really love the heat produced by this natural Jade tourmaline heating pad, the burning smell makes me afraid to use it. It is nice and large, but the stiffness of the material is a bit uncomfortable, as well.

1,A Stylist's View: Not so versatile. Cold temp only on  but high wind speed.,"Update 2/5/22: I tried to give this blow dryer a shot on the highest wind setting at medium heat. Mind you, it normally takes less than 10 minutes to dry my terribly fine thin hair. It didn't even make it halfway through before it crapped out. Dead. The plug didn't shut it off. It just died. With all of its shortcomings and now this, it's a definite no go...<br /><br />2/3/22: This ENISECA 1875 Watt Negative Ionic Hair Dryer is not as versatile as it is made out to be. I was really looking forward to being able to change the temperature and wind settings to my liking. I have fine thin hair, and need a lower speed with hotter temperatures than most blow dryers have. With this blow dryer, it's impossible.<br />The only time you can adjust the temperature is if it's on the highest wind speed, which is totally ridiculous. If you lower the wind speed at all, it goes to the coldest temperature, which is even more ridiculous. I do appreciate being able to change the temperature on the highest wind setting, but I need a lower wind setting and a higher temperature setting than cold. And, I do mean cold.<br />After deciphering the meaning behind this seemingly faulty setting, they make it appear that a lower wind speed should only have low temperatures for children's sake. I didn't buy this blow dryer for a child, I bought it for myself. Furthermore, I would not want to blow dry my child's hair with cold air.<br />This blow dryer could have been a super win all around, but instead it's a flop for me. It's fine if you only blow dry your hair on a medium/high speed at all times, but for those of us who don't or can't do that, it's pretty much useless. Just to note, the highest wind speed setting is not nearly high enough to please those with thick long hair, but it  get extremely hot.

2,"A powerful TENS unit, posing as a gimmicky body slimming device.","This can be a very dangerous and TENS unit. It is not a slimming instrument. It is very much like the devices used in doctors and physical therapy offices. It comes with a less than adequate ""manual"", with over-the-top claims of making you slim and trim, increasing your bust size, among many other crazy things.<br />This should come with much better instructions, warnings, and contraindications. There are so many ways that you can use a TENS unit in the wrong way that is very dangerous and life-threatening. There is no mention of warnings or contraindications, whatsoever, in the hyped up ""manual"".<br />What my sensitive nerves experienced were unpleasant muscle contractions, along with zaps and zings to the point that I could not stand it. I can use a regular TENS unit on lower settings, but the ""Instrument"" I received is a bit unstable, and every electrode does not put out the same strength/intensity on the chosen stimulation mode. I used ultrasound gel and made sure the electrodes were well covered, but it didn't seem to make a difference. I still got zapped by one electrode or another. Maybe this machine is just too strong for my nerves. They are rather sensitive.<br />This might work as a very good TENS unit for some people, but I don't believe one word about it toning your body, making you lose weight, enhancing your breast or any other part of your body. Those are just outright lies. That is why they put hyphens in between such words in the listing.<br />Many people would love such a device for the relief of pain without being told it will help them lose weight, develop strong and beautiful breasts, and even prevent cancer, when it clearly will not.

I've used real sandalwood and it's dupe, Amyris essential oil, which is known as West Indian Sandalwood.<br />Real Sandalwood essential oil is extremely expensive. Most inexpensive Sandalwood that is sold on the market is actually Amyris (Balsamifera) Essential Oil, better known as West Indian Sandalwood, which smells very similar, but costs much less.<br />This Sandalwood does not smell like Sandalwood, nor does it smell like Amyris. It reminds me more of a middle eastern fragrance oil that is light in nature, and very perfume-like. There are no sweet notes of benzoin or vanilla that dry down to blend with the soft, warm notes that are woodsy and a bit smokey. In fact, this oil is not reminiscent of Sandalwood at all, to my nose. It has more of a feminine perfume like scent.<br />I would definitely search for true Sandalwood, which is extremely expensive, or the much more affordable, Amyris Essential Oil.

4,"A Cosmetologist's view: Easy to put together, easy-to-use, and feels great.","This facial steamer comes in pieces in a plain cardboard box. There are instructions on how to put it together and how to use it, but it's pretty self-explanatory. Once together, you fill the steamer cup to the max line with hot tap water, add essential oils to a cotton swab and stick it in the aromatherapy bud holder next to the nozzle, if desired, and turn the heat and light on. Within just a few moments, there's a steady stream of steam coming out of the nozzle. It goes a fair distance, but to get the best coverage of your face with the steam, you will want to be about 15 inches below the nozzle.<br />The steam feels really wonderful and relaxing! It runs for about 4 to 5 minutes and really opens your pores to help clean away any impurities.<br />I really like the simplicity of this facial steamer, but would not consider it professional quality. The mechanical portion and cup are made of very lightweight plastic, do not seem extremely durable, and it is very basic in its function. I have been a cosmetologist for over 30 years, and this is more suited for home use.<br />Using this facial steamer is a great way to take care of your skin and a wonderful way to spend time doing some self-care. There's nothing like spending some time a day or two each week and really taking good care of your skin. This facial steamer will help you do that in the comfort of your own home, and save you money at the same time.

This little cleaning brush does not cause that and gives a great cleaning for everyday. And, it really gets into the creases around the nose and does great for cleaning out your pores.<br />I use a micellar gel cleanser with this and usually go through two 90 second sessions on the nights I don't use Retin-A, and one very light pressure session on the nights I do. I then apply my skincare or my Retin-A. About once a week I use my regular cleansing brush to do a deep clean, but only for a minute or two.<br />I really love this little flower sonic cleansing brush.

The paper instructions were much easier to take in my bathroom as I tried for the first time instead of my laptop and a video.<br /><br />I tried both functions on my arm first. The high speed of the epilator was a bit uncomfortable.  Tried on my face.  Tried the razor first.  Then changed to the epilator. I first tried on low and then on high.  Mistake!  The machine literally caught my skin in it when on high speed.  It cut the surface of the skin and left a mark like a cat scratched my face...see photo!  That was it…..I was done. No more!<br /><br />There are 2 detachable pieces to switch between depending upon whether you want to use razor or epilator mode.  They easily come off.  It's clear/obvious how to align each piece and attach.<br /><br />Couple of notes:<br /><br />On/off button is ""stiff' to use.  It doesn't ""glide"" on/off.  Not a problem.

4,Packs a Punch at 10k IU!,"Up until recently, it's been hard to find good vegan sources of D3. This is a powerful source of veggie D3 that packs double the punch of my usual supplies of vitamin D3. Usually, I find 5,000 IU to be the standard. I've read varying opinions about 5k+, and have heard that the body doesn't absorb larger amounts as well as 2k or smaller. The National Academy of Medicine lists the upper daily limit at 4,000 IU, though doses up to 10,000 IU have been found NOT to cause toxicity in healthy humans. For this reason, I won't be taking daily mega-doses of vitamin D. I will take these capsules once or twice a week in supplement to my daily multivitamin, which contains 100% of my daily supply of vitamin D. I like taking more, especially during the winter, as my health insurance does not approve vitamin D tests in healthy individuals my age.<br /><br />All that said, this is a good quality mushroom-based source of vitamin D3, formulated by a former Cleveland Clinic doctor.

4,Helps relieve back and neck pain,"Over the past eight months, I’ve tried a few different neck traction pillows. I’ve found they are all quite similar and accomplish the same goal, with only slight variations in design. This one, like most others, is made of a hard foam with just the slightest bit of give when you rest your head on it. It’s possible to use the pillow in either direction, one way providing a more gentle stretch, the other, a more intense stretch. This pillow does not have the bumps and nodes that some others have which are supposed to provide some acupressure and massage to your neck, though I can’t say that they make much of a difference for me. This pillow does, however, have a softer cushion in the center that makes it a little more comfortable on the back of my head. It's a very nice feature.<br /><br />If you’re new to this type of device, go slow. When I first used one of these pillows, I could only lie on it for a few minutes at a time, but have worked my way up to 10-15 minutes twice a day. I also recommend starting with the side that gives you the more gentle stretch. For me, using a device like this has provided quite a lot of relief to my neck and shoulders that tend to carry a lot of tension since I sit at a computer all day.<br /><br />If you’re looking for an alternative to medication for some relief for back and neck pain, this is definitely worth a try.",[],B09R3JHKPX,B09R3JHKPX,AGQFUBXP54N5SB54U5LRPL62B2NQ,2022-03-08 22:06:18.496,2,False,2781,"('POSITIVE', 0.9951539039611816)",POSITIVE,0.9951539039611816

4,All-natural pain relief,"This is easy to apply with a convenient roller applicator bottle. The gel has a strong menthol smell, much like IcyHot or similar products. It goes on wet, takes a few minutes to dry, and the smell lingers, though personally I like the smell of it. A few minutes after applying to my lower back, I started to feel the icy cool sensation that brought some relief to the ache in my back. The feeling lasted a few hours, after which time I reapplied. My tight back was loosened and less achy after using the hemp gel.

4,"Fresh, long-lasting scent","The minty eucalyptus scent of this room spray has a wonderful, fresh scent. Just a few spritzes freshens an entire room, and the fragrance lasts a long time. The bottle has an easy to use pump sprayer that emits a very fine mist. There is a toggle switch that enables you to lock the sprayer until you’re ready to use it. The mist will dampen the surface on which it falls, but I didn’t notice any slipperiness or stickiness where the mist fell. The label touts several things such as pure and natural essential oils, being free of solvents, petroleum derivatives, and artificial dyes or colors, and the fact that the spray is pet friendly and vegan. What the labeling does not have is a list of ingredients. No where on the bottle or box, or even online, could I find a complete list of what’s in the spray. I would like to know. Calling it “pure and natural” is fine, but I feel this should be backed up with an accurate listing of ingredients. Also odd is that there is no mention on the bottle label of what scent is inside the bottle. Aside from a sticker attached to the box, the scent isn’t on the outer packaging either. Perhaps it’s a new product and the packaging and labeling will change with time.<br />Assuming there are no potentially dangerous ingredients lurking in the formula, this is a spray that I would recommend for freshening your home with (hopefully) natural ingredients.",[],B09GLJF549,B09GLJF549,AGQFUBXP54N5SB54U5LRPL62B2NQ,2021-12-07 22:01:20.552,0,False,2784,"('NEGATIVE', 0.9179859757423401)",NEGATIVE,0.9179859757423401
5,Provides an excellent neck stretch,"I have tried a few different versions of neck traction devices/neck stretchers and have found they all are quite similar with some slight variations in size and design.<br />This one is slightly smaller than others, something that works well for me at 5’-4”. Like the others, it is not soft despite what it may look like. The foam is very hard, as it’s intended to be, in order to support your head and neck and to provide a thorough stretch. There are also some “pressure nodes” on the device which are really just bumps in the foam but are positioned to provide a bit of acupressure and massage while you’re lying on it. Personally, I don’t notice the bumps, but it’s possible they’re doing their job.<br />If you’re new to this type of neck device, know that it takes a while to get used to it. When I first started, it was quite painful, and I managed only a couple of minutes at a time. Now, I use it once or twice a day for about ten minutes at a time. The benefits are immediately noticeable as it relieves the tension in my neck and shoulders that always develops after a day spent at my computer.<br />This particular device, unlike others I have used, comes with a zippered carrying/storage bag, as well as an eye mask and ear plugs. None of these are crucial to the neck traction device, but are nice extras. Some reviewers noted a bad smell when they received their device. I had no such issues with mine.<br />If  you’re looking for a way to relieve neck and shoulder pain without resorting to medication, this is definitely worth a try.",[],B09DPZ278D,B09DPZ278D,AGQFUBXP54N5SB54U5LRPL62B2NQ,2021-10-30 14:32:28.886,0,False,2785,"('POSITIVE', 0.9919419288635254)",POSITIVE,0.9919419288635254
4,Soft and comfortable,"Mellygova Bathtub Pillow<br /><br />This bath pillow is very thick and soft with a mesh covering that helps it dry fairly quickly. There are six suction cups to keep it secured to the tub; two  on the rounded top part, four on the larger, lower part. I found that with my free-standing tub which does not have much of a lip on the back, rather it’s just straight, the top part didn’t hold very well. Still, I was able to sort of flip it over the back and use it as a headrest, as intended. The pillow is going to fit different in different shaped and styled tubs, so you’ll have to find what works best given your situation.<br />That said, the pillow is very comfortable and provides plenty of cushioning against the back of the tub, making for a pleasant bath experience. I have used inflatable bath pillows in the past, and they can’t hold a candle to this type of pillow as far as comfort goes. There is a hook on one end of the pillow and if you hang it after use, it drains and dries well. There were no strange smells, loose threads, weak seams, or any other defects with the pillow. There also were no care instructions included, but on the Amazon product page, it says the pillow is machine washable. I haven’t tried that, and may not unless it gets really dirty, but hopefully the claim holds true.<br />This is a good choice for a comfortable, smaller bath pillow.",[],B09CT79946,B09CT79946,AGQFUBXP54N5SB54U5LRPL62B2NQ,2021-10-12 20:32:27.408,1,False,2786,"('NEGATIVE', 0.9473707675933838)",NEGATIVE,0.9473707675933838

4,Provide cushioning but will make your shoes feel tighter,"PerseveranX Shoe Inserts<br /><br />The shoe inserts arrived in a plain pink box and included no instructions. Not that instructions are specifically needed, but I found it kind of odd there was nothing but the box and the pads. There are enough for two pairs of shoes. Upon seeing the thickness, I was afraid they would make my shoes too tight. I was pleasantly surprised when I put on my shoes and they felt comfortable; a little tighter, but still comfortable. The information provided on the product page does warn that the inserts will take up some space in your shoes and recommends buying up a shoe size. This isn’t going to help if you already have the shoes.<br />The inserts do exactly what they claim to do in that they relieve some of the discomfort to my feet when I wear high heels. I didn’t notice that my feet were any hotter or sweatier than they would have been without the inserts (it was a very warm day). My only complaint is that with open-sided shoes, the blue foam shows. I’m not sure how long the cushioning effect will last until the pads have to be replaced, but so far, so good.",[],B09BLJ4Q3V,B09BLJ4Q3V,AGQFUBXP54N5SB54U5LRPL62B2NQ,2021-09-19 21:01:35.668,1,False,2790,"('POSITIVE', 0.9418231844902039)",POSITIVE,0.9418231844902039
5,Relief from neck and shoulder pain,"This is the second neck traction pillow I have tried. While they are very similar and accomplish the same goal, this one is a bit softer and has a bit more give than the other one I tried. Personally, I like this one better. At 5’-4”, I think this one fits me better. I’ve had my family members try both, and they had different preferences. My son, who is a foot taller than me at 6’-4” preferred the “harder” one. From that, I have to surmise that being taller, with a longer neck so his head falls back farther, the firmer one is better suited to taller people, but I also have to believe the decision is going to be highly personal.<br />As far as the results, I’m extremely pleased with the noticeable improvement in my neck and shoulder pain. Since I work all day at a computer, I always seem to have tension in my neck. If I take a break and use the traction pillow a couple of times during the day, the relief is immediate. It does take some getting used to, I found it quite uncomfortable at first and had to gradually build the amount of time I could lie on it, but it’s much more natural now and I look forward to my few minutes on it.<br />If you’re looking for an inexpensive, medication-free way to relieve some neck pain, I highly recommend giving this neck pillow a try.",[],B093GXZC2G,B093GXZC2G,AGQFUBXP54N5SB54U5LRPL62B2NQ,2021-09-17 23:38:51.720,1,False,2791,"('POSITIVE', 0.989062488079071)",POSITIVE,0.989062488079071

4,good for travel,"[[VIDEOID:403658bf718edafc4abb9ea7d8ac46fa]] I'm only allowed to attach 1 video per review, so check out the pulsation mode video I posted! The regular mode is what I've been using and I'm waiting to grab some distilled water so I can use the nasal irrigator.<br /><br />I'm going home for a wedding next month and I don't wanna bring my regular water flosser, so this thing is a Godsend! My only complaint is the water resevoir could be tighter because if you tilt it, water can spill out. One fill up is just enough to floss your entire mouth. I have only used on level 1 because I can tell the other modes might be too strong for me. You might like em though! It's pleasing to the eye and I love that it came with a carrying bag.

It's kind of lemony and also, somehow, chalky. If you've ever smelled Nubian Heritage Lemongrass and Tea Tree lotion, it's exactly like that. The texture of the powder is nice. It seemed to do a good job of keeping my armpits dry (in combination with a non-anti-perspirant natural deodorant) but the scent didn't last, and it didn't help keep away any odor. I think this could be a good anti-chafing powder, or something to use under huge breasts in hot weather.  Could be fine for babies, too. It's not terrible but I'm not fond of the scent and the other powder works better for me overall. I'll keep using this until I run out, but I'll go back to the other brand as soon as that happens.

I may hurt at times but the most pads I need are 4 to cover my sore areas.<br />I'm still learning what all the pictures on the device actually mean.  The best way to learn is by just trying them all out to see what mode is best for you for a certain area and what intensity works the best.<br />My first encounter with a stims unit or called tens unit is at a chiropractors office.  I would feel so good after going through a session.<br />After that I had to have one and purchased my first tens unit about 15 yrs ago.  Haven't been without one since.<br />These are so good with helping with my tension headaches.  I place the pads on my upper back/shoulder blade area.  It really helps loosen the muscles and relieving my headaches.<br />They're also great with lower back pain.  Pads placed on the lower back on each side of my spine and within about 90 mins I am feeling so much better.<br />Driving also makes my back hurt.  I can have the pads on and running while I'm driving which really helps me sit for longer periods so I can drive longer distances.<br />For any muscle ache on any part of your body, minus the chest area, and the relief is priceless.<br />If you've never tried a tens unit, you really should try one out and see how good it feels after using one.<br />I like this unit.

The specific strains are listed on the bottle, but not the specific concentration of each.<br /><br />It delivers the 25 billion CFUs with a serving size of only 1 capsule (2 caps are the more common situation), making this bottle of 30 caps a month's supply.<br /><br />The downside is the price. There are a number of probiotic options that achieve the same (or sometimes better) potency and strain diversity at a far lower price for a month's supply.<br /><br />While the formulation is solid, the very high price puts my rating at 3 stars (average). Equally good options are available that are a much better value.",[],B09WQC6ZZV,B09WQC6ZZV,AG63W2BMC4HRP76AMS36AYY64AHA,2022-11-01 01:08:52.442,0,False,2861,"('NEGATIVE', 0.9726935029029846)",NEGATIVE,0.9726935029029846
3,"Great resource-saving format, but higher price than similar sheets; non-ideal packaging","This type of cleaning format is outstanding for resource conservation. It comes in sheets that dissolve far more readily and quickly than the tablet format concentrates. The sheets are easy to cut (or tear) if you need a smaller amount for the task.<br /><br />While these sheets are positioned as a floor cleaner (and it works pretty well for that task) they can also be used as a general purpose spray cleaner. I use a sheet for a 32oz bottle, and the spray does a fine job for counters, sinks, and other general cleaning tasks. The scent is reasonably pleasant, but I would have preferred no scent as other sheets offer.<br /><br />There are some cons, however. First, the cost is higher than similar sheet-based concentrates, and the performance is no different than the lower cost options. Second, the packaging is not ideal for sheets. The sheets are somewhat delicate and must be kept totally dry in storage or they will dissolve. The sheets are packaged in a cardboard box in a single clump. Other manufacturers use a plastic box or, if a cardboard box is used, the sheets are divided up into smaller groups.<br /><br />Factoring in the cons puts my score at 3 stars. Although the sheet format is perfect for eliminating plastic waste and is easier to use than the tablet-based format, there are better sheet options available at a lower price.",[],B09ZX63GTJ,B09ZX63GTJ,AG63W2BMC4HRP76AMS36AYY64AHA,2022-07-29 10:46:20.109,0,False,2862,"('NEGATIVE', 0.9955129027366638)",NEGATIVE,0.9955129027366638
1,"Compact size, but defective right out of the box","This could be a useful mini razor for traveling. I say ""could"" since I can't say how well it shaves -- I was never able to get it to turn on. I initially thought it was shipped with a discharged battery, which is sometimes the case with rechargeable products. However, after letting it charge for a few hours, it still would not turn on. The shaver got rather warm while charging, and the charge indicator light turned on, but those were the only indications of life.<br /><br />The design is something I've not come across before. It's a rotary shaver, but the heads are arranged in a straight line. The heads are smaller than is customary on a rotary. The construction is all plastic and feels rather cheap. Still, it has some nice grip points and feels pretty good in hand. As a travel shaver, the lightweight nature and the smaller size could be plusses.<br /><br />Since it failed to turn on at all, the only rating I can give is 1 star. A shame, since I would have liked to see the shaving performance of the linear-arranged rotary heads.",[],B09PFZQ8YB,B09PFZQ8YB,AG63W2BMC4HRP76AMS36AYY64AHA,2022-06-30 02:14:54.427,0,False,2863,"('NEGATIVE', 0.9929401874542236)",NEGATIVE,0.9929401874542236
1,"Nice small size, but super cheap build quality","I like the size of these boxes. They are small - the interior dimensions are 3.5 inches by 4 inches, and it's about 1.5 inches deep. It's a good size for items such as jewelry or other similar items. However, the build quality is so poor that these are pretty useless as gift boxes.<br /><br />It folds together like most gift boxes, with the sides held in by adhesive pads. However, the cut accuracy is poor, so the sides don't meet up well with the top (or each other). The magnetic flap will not hold shut. The carboard is thin and doesn't have a substantial feel. Instead of having a box that dresses up what's inside, this box cheapens the contents since it looks and feels so poorly made. And won't even stay shut!<br /><br />The cost is way out of range for such a poorly made gift box. It's not something I would recommend.

5,Very good performance; nice size; good value,"No complaints at all about this silicone scar sheets. The material is nicely durable, and peels off the backing without issue. It adheres very well. I use this on the back of my hand and it stays put for the whole day without a problem. Despite the good adhesion it is not painful to remove and it leaves no residue behind.<br /><br />The size is well suited to small areas so that you don't need to waste any in trimming. The cost per inch (or foot) is quite good since this comes in a 120 inch (10 foot) roll. It stores well -- the roll I received in January 2022 has an expiration date of September 2024.<br /><br />I'm not sure of the country of manufacture. It is distributed by a French company, but it doesn't specifically state where it is made.<br /><br />No complaints. It's a good quality silicone sheet that works well and is a good value price-wise.

4,Light but effective cooling; less greasy than other options; non-offensive scent,"This is a decent cooling muscle rub. It's a roll-on, so it's easy to apply even on areas such as my lower back. It's far less messy than the creams/lotion formats. It goes on wet but soaks in fairly well, and doesn't leave a greasy residue behind, which is a major plus.<br /><br />The scent is menthol and, while it's clearly noticeable, it's not as strong as other menthol-based rubs I've used. It has more of a minty/menthol scent than a strong menthol-only scent. I would stop short of calling it an enjoyable scent, but it's at least non-offensive.<br /><br />The cooling performance is light but still effective. It takes a few minutes to build up the cooling. The cooling is not as strong or long-lasting as others -- I find that I need to re-apply this more often than other options.. Still, the lack of greasiness, lower odor, and the ease of application balance that out.<br /><br />The addition of hemp seed oil doesn't make a noticeable difference compared with formulations that lack hemp seed oil. That's to be expected since it does not contain CBD, but rather just hemp seed oil. It seems more like a marketing strategy to capitalize on the hemp trend (and justify a higher price) rather than an addition that actually impacts efficacy.<br /><br />The scent, ease of use, and non-greasy nature are all 5 stars; the cooling impact is 4 stars; the price/value is 3 stars.

3,OK taste; sticks to teeth; serving size is 3 gummies so not a great value,"These are OK fiber gummies. Each serving provides 5g of fiber, which is decent but not outstanding. Additionally, a serving consists of THREE gummies, so a bottle of 60 will last only 20 days. The taste is fine (sort of a berry-ish flavor mostly) but there's 3g of added sugar per serving (sugar is the second most common ingredient), which is rather high. The consistency is firm bordering on rubbery, and it sticks to my teeth, which is annoying.<br /><br />The fiber is from chicory root which is the usual go-to source for fiber in gummies. It uses natural flavors and natural colors, which is a plus.  The country of manufacture is not listed on the bottle, which can mean that it's not made in the US.<br /><br />Weighing all the factors (taste, formulation, serving size, cost, ease of use) puts my rating at three stars (average). It's not a bad fiber gummy, but it's not outstanding compared with other similar options that are available.",[],B09JG2G5FJ,B09JG2G5FJ,AG63W2BMC4HRP76AMS36AYY64AHA,2021-11-17 19:29:50.233,0,False,2867,"('NEGATIVE', 0.9714661240577698)",NEGATIVE,0.9714661240577698
3,Excellent strain diversity but very low potency; potential option for children/elderly,"These probiotics hit the mark when it comes to strain diversity, with each capsule providing 14 different strains. The strains are identified on the bottle label, but the specific concentration of each one is not. However, the mark of a good probiotic is both diverse strains plus a good potency. This falls quite short on the potency side, with each capsule providing only 3 billion CFUs. I find a minimum of 20 billion is what I need for good results (digestive and elimination benefits). As such, these don't hit the mark.<br /><br />However, for those who have difficulty tolerating high potency levels, such as younger children and the elderly, this is a decent option. The price is excellent for a 60 capsule bottle. While child-focused probiotics are usually chewable, these capsules should be small enough for most to swallow.<br /><br />As an general adult probiotic I'd give these 2 stars, but as a low-potency child/elderly/sensitive stomach probiotic, it's a 4 star option for the price. I'll average the two and give it 3 stars.",[],B08FPHWHGS,B08FPHWHGS,AG63W2BMC4HRP76AMS36AYY64AHA,2021-10-15 23:27:33.450,0,False,2868,"('POSITIVE', 0.7991183400154114)",POSITIVE,0.7991183400154114
3,"Good fitment, nicely soft bristles, but don't care for the bristle arrangement","The overall fit and finish of these replacement heads is pretty good. They fit well on my Oral-B toothbrush without any wiggling or vibration during use. The bristles are soft, but not as soft as the Braun Sensitive heads. It's pretty close, however.<br /><br />What I don't care for is the bristle arrangement. The outer ring of bristles is raised above the inner bristles. They flare out in use and irritate my gums. It's not terrible, but it's enough irritation that I would not get these again, and probably won't use all of the 12.<br /><br />While the bristle softness is reasonably close the the Braun Sensitive version, the bristle arrangement makes them ill suited for those with sensitive gums. I'll give them three stars since, if you don't have sensitive gums, these are decent replacements at a very reasonable cost. However, if you're looking for a less expensive version of the Braun Sensitive, these are not ideal.",[],B09BQMQXTD,B09BQMQXTD,AG63W2BMC4HRP76AMS36AYY64AHA,2021-09-23 18:53:50.301,0,False,2869,"('NEGATIVE', 0.9559922218322754)",NEGATIVE,0.9559922218322754
5,Nice flavor and consistency; good formulation,"I'm pleased with these Vitamin C gummies. They have a light citrus taste that's very pleasant. The consistency is perfect -- soft enough to easily chew but not something that sticks to my teeth. The gummies are covered with granular sugar which keeps them from sticking to one another even in humid weather.<br /><br />The Vitamin C content is decent, with each serving of 2 gummies providing 240mg. That's not as high as other gummies, but for me, it's a good dosage level. The echinacea content is pretty low at 3.5mg per serving. Still, I use these for the Vitamin C so the echinacea is more like a bonus than something I find essential to have. The price is a little high but not out of range for a 60 count bottle.<br /><br />Overall score of 4.5 stars.

5,Very good build quality; better for dry mopping vs wet mopping,"These are well-made mop heads. The microfiber center had zero loose or puckered threads, and the density of the microfiber was nicely dense for good pick-up performance. The fringe around the edge is stitched on well, and also did not have any loose or pulled threads. They fit and work well with many platform mops provided that the mop has Velcro on the underside of the platform to grip the pad.<br /><br />These work very well when dry mopping. The microfiber picks up and holds an impressive amount of dust, pet hair and other similar gunk. The fringe around the edge makes it easy to clean right up to the baseboard or, if used in the kitchen, at the cabinet toe kick area. It also helps ensure that the mop doesn't mar any chair legs or furniture if it gets bumped while mopping.<br /><br />The performance is not as good as a wet mop due to the fringe. That's not a problem specific to these pads, but occurs with any pad that has an outer fringe. It's certainly useable and effective as a wet mop, but a non-fringe mop head usually performs better.<br /><br />The set comes incased in a sealed plastic pouch which keeps them nice and clean during transit, and can also be used to keep them clean in storage.<br /><br />A very good mop head - five stars.",[],B08ZHHLHSP,B08ZHHLHSP,AG63W2BMC4HRP76AMS36AYY64AHA,2021-07-26 01:27:38.619,0,False,2871,"('POSITIVE', 0.9901453256607056)",POSITIVE,0.9901453256607056
4,"Low potency, but good strain diversity; includes cranberry","This is an OK, but not outstanding probiotic. The potency is rather low, with each capsule providing only 5 billion CFUs.

The strains are identified on the bottle, but the specific concentration of each is not.<br /><br />In addition to the probiotics, it includes 3,000mg of cranberry. However, it's 3,000mg equivalent of fresh cranberries. Using a scale based on dried cranberry shows that it's 60mg of a 50:1 concentrate. All this info is on the label, so there's no issue with inflated potency levels, and it's a technique used by other cranberry supplements.<br /><br />The price is quite reasonable for a 50 capsule bottle. While the probiotic potency is not ideal, it's great to have the addition of cranberry, and the strain diversity is good. Factoring all those together puts me at 3.5 stars. A bit better than average, but not ideal.",[],B08FPQN3QS,B08FPQN3QS,AG63W2BMC4HRP76AMS36AYY64AHA,2021-06-25 22:58:47.421,2,False,2872,"('POSITIVE', 0.8358035087585449)",POSITIVE,0.8358035087585449

It's a generic floral scent -- not all that different from a general air freshener type of scent, but not bad. It's certainly better than the odor it helps mitigate.<br /><br />As with other similar sprays, you need to use it before the toilet is used for maximum effectiveness. It has limited benefits if used after the toilet is used.

2,Limited scent; more floral/chemical than pear,"I'm not impressed with this toilet spray. The scent is quite modest, and it requires several sprays to produce any appreciable scent. The scent is has is more of a floral/chemical type of scent than pear. In fact, if I didn't know it was a pear scent I would have not guessed it from how it smells.<br /><br />It does have some benefit as an odor preventer in the bathroom. The spray is used before the toilet is used, creating a film type of barrier to minimize odor. It does have some effectiveness in that regard, but other similar products I've used have far more scent to them (and a more pleasant scent as well).<br /><br />Since it does provide some benefits, I'll give it 2 stars.

Granted, pretty much any scent is better than the scent this is meant to cover up, but the Sea Salt scent is more floral than I was expecting. It's an OK scent, but not 100% to my liking. The other issue I've had is that the sprayer doesn't always spray properly. Instead of a mist, it sort of splatters the liquid at times, making a bit of a mess unless your aim is perfectly true. It's only happening with one of the containers, so it seems that the sprayer is defective.

5,Very impressive performance for the price,"I wasn't expecting a whole lot from these clippers given the price point (ten bucks as of this review). I was really surprised at how well these work. The blades cut as well as models costing far more. A nice, clean cut without any pulling or abrasion. The length dial works very well. It has a nice, smooth action with a solid, positive click stop for each length. It comes with two guides so you have two sets of adjustability lengths.<br /><br />Where the cost-cutting is seen is with the case and attachment build quality. It's all plastic and doesn't have much of a solid heft to it. I very much doubt this would survive a fall of a few feet onto a hard floor. I'm not willing to test that out, so I may be wrong about that, but the very plasticy nature of the clippers don't make me at all confident in their ability to shrug off damage. The guide combs are also rather thin, but since they connect to the body with an internal peg (versus having to pull them off the blade itself) the thinner build quality is fine with regard to durability.<br /><br />It charges with a USB C cable (included) which is a nice change from having to keep and use a transformer specifically for the clipper.  The motor has a muted buzz that is reasonably quiet and not annoying. There's only one control, which is a sliding on/off. It clicks firmly into place and stays put in use.<br /><br />While these are lightweight in terms of build quality, it punches well above its weight class when it comes to performance.

As such, it works the same as other sensitive toothpastes.<br /><br />It does differ from others with regard to taste and consistency. It has a mild minty taste that, while acceptable, is not all that fresh tasting. The consistency is a bit softer than other toothpastes and it doesn't foam up as much. While that's usually a plus, good foaming action is a benefit when it comes to sensitive toothpastes since it helps the potassium nitrate get into all the nooks and crannies. My favorite sensitive toothpaste is the Colgate foaming action one. It has the same 5% potassium nitrate as this, but the foaming action does make a difference.<br /><br />While the tube looks big, there's not a lot of product. It's only filled about 1/2 of the way and, while it looks like a standard size tube, it only provides 3.5 oz of toothpaste. It's also hard to get all of it out of the tube since the tube is plastic and does not roll up. It dispenses fine when mostly full, but is not great at dispensing when the level gets low.<br /><br />While this does work, the negatives put my score at 3 stars (average).

This is no exception.<br /><br />Chia seeds can be used in numerous ways, and have an excellent nutritional profile. I've been using these mainly as an egg substitute with very good results. Just soak 1 tablespoon of chia seeds in 3 tablespoons of water for 10 min (longer is better) and use it in place of eggs in baked goods. In addition to acting as a binding agent, the seeds provide a very gentle crunch that I find very appealing.<br /><br />The only quibble I have is that the included set of measuring spoons is pretty cheaply made. It's not a reflection on the chia seeds themselves, but it's odd that such a cheap set would be included.<br /><br />That aside, zero complaints. The chia seeds are fresh, tasty, packaged well, and one of those good-for-you foods that actually is appealing to use.

4,Compact size; lots of sound options; controls could be better,"Overall, this is a pretty good white noise machine. It's very compact, which is a plus since I don't have a lot of bedside table area available. This has a smaller footprint than my last white noise machine, making it also a handy item if you want to take it while traveling.<br /><br />Setup is simple, and there's a good selection of sounds to choose from. I stick with the white noise, but it's nice to have options just to experiment with them to see which work the best. The variety also makes this useful not only for adults, but for infants/children to help them sleep. The sound volume has a good range, and the light feature is also a nice touch, even though it's not something I get much use out of.<br /><br />The main con is the control panel. It's hard to see which control is which, especially in dim light. I would prefer a more traditional button system with nice, clear text labels as to function. Or, better yet, some type of simple remote where the buttons light up. Granted, that would increase the price but the layout presently used can be really frustrating to use.<br /><br />One star down for the control system but otherwise, a very nice compact sound machine.",[],B08TW9W6V3,B08TW9W6V3,AG63W2BMC4HRP76AMS36AYY64AHA,2021-03-04 19:10:29.881,0,False,2884,"('POSITIVE', 0.9984057545661926)",POSITIVE,0.9984057545661926
1,Very poor quality and design,"I'm not at all impressed with this scrubber brush. The only positive is that it comes with 8 refill heads. The list of cons, however, is far longer:<br /><br />> the handle is not sealed well, and will continually leak dish soap;<br />> it does NOT come with the scrubber brush pictured -- only the scrubber pads;<br />> the word ""scrubber"" is used loosely since the pads have the texture of semi-rough felt. They lack any meaningful scrubber ability;<br />> the pads are attached to the plastic holder with tape that has velcro on one side, and adhesive on the other (with the adhesive sticking to the plastic holder). The adhesive is quite poor, and the pads easily detach from the holder.<br /><br />It doesn't come close to being worth the price charged. At best, this entire set is something that belongs in a dollar store, and I'm not sure it would even be worth that. A very disappointing product.",[],B08M9B3NRQ,B08M9B3NRQ,AG63W2BMC4HRP76AMS36AYY64AHA,2021-02-28 19:25:35.132,0,False,2885,"('NEGATIVE', 0.99970942735672)",NEGATIVE,0.99970942735672
5,Excellent flavor and aroma; nicely packaged,"No complaints about this turmeric powder. The aroma when opening the bag was very rich. The taste was also excellent, and not at all muted as some turmeric's I've used. I use this mainly with rice (or rice substitutes such as wheat berries, couscous, and the like) and both the taste and the strong yellow color make for a tasty dish.<br /><br />I like that, while it is priced similar to a bulk item, it comes in three fairly small (4 oz) bags. That allows for cost savings by buying in bulk, but the smaller packages help maintain the freshness until it's ready to be used.<br /><br />Fresh, tasty and a good value.

5,"Excellent quality cloth, but could be larger","I'm impressed with the quality of these microfiber cloths given the price. The cloth is thick, sturdy and well-made. There were no loose threads or pulled out areas, and the hem stitching is very well done. The thickness is especially important for performance since thicker cloths are able to hold more liquid, plus do a better job on high gloss areas such as tile, appliances and windows.  These are much better quality than I expected them to be.<br /><br />The only downside is the size. Each cloth is just shy of 12 inches square. That's decent, but a bit larger (such as 14 inches square) would make them even more useful. As they are, I often have to use two where I normally would use one larger microfiber cloth.<br /><br />They launder well. As with any microfiber cloth, it's better to let them air dry (a very quick process) rather than put them in the dryer. If they are machine dried, it's essential to not use a fabric softener sheet (nor use fabric softener in the wash) since that coats and gums up the microfibers, making them less absorbent and less able to trap and hold dirt.<br /><br />If these were larger they would be a solid 5 stars. As-is, they are 4.5 stars. I'll round up to 5 since, for the price, I've not come across as good of a quality microfiber cloths as these. Very pleased with the performance.",[],B08FQY3DLY,B08FQY3DLY,AG63W2BMC4HRP76AMS36AYY64AHA,2020-10-25 19:13:36.451,2,False,2887,"('POSITIVE', 0.7489017248153687)",POSITIVE,0.7489017248153687
2,"Handy size, but poor build quality","I like the overall size of this scrubber, both in terms of the handle length and the size of the pads. The handle is large enough to allow for a good grip, and the scrubbers are small enough to get into corners while still decently sized for larger surfaces. It is also pretty comprehensive, including both scrubber attachments as well as a bristle attachment.<br /><br />Unfortunately, everything else about this set is not good. The bristle attachment arrived with all the bristles bent and folded, probably due to the fact that the items are all loose in a box. The bristles never returned to the proper shape after a few days, so the bent areas are permanent, making it hard to use. The handle leaked right from the start -- all the soap emptied out overnight, wasting soap and making a mess. The pads are of poor quality and fall apart after very little use. Worst of all, the handle area where the pads fit cracked, so pads will no longer stay in place. And all this was within 3 days of use.<br /><br />While the overall size and shape merits a good rating, the very poor quality, especially given the price, puts my rating at 2 stars. This is not a scrubber I would recommend.",[],B08B5Q96GF,B08B5Q96GF,AG63W2BMC4HRP76AMS36AYY64AHA,2020-09-22 13:37:36.616,1,False,2888,"('NEGATIVE', 0.998184859752655)",NEGATIVE,0.998184859752655
5,"Strong enough for re-use; thin, but good absorption","These are excellent towels for certain cleaning tasks. They are thin, but absorb quickly and hold a decent amount of water. They can be rinsed, laid flat to dry, and re-used several times, making them go a lot further than a roll of conventional paper towels.<br /><br />They are ideal for certain cleaning tasks, especially windows, glass, smooth tile and other types of smooth surfaces. They are not, however, all that good for scrubbing or use over a rough surface. They can be used for that, but the roughness will shred the towel making it only good for one use. If used on smooth surfaces, they can be rinsed and re-used multiple times.<br /><br />For me, these are ideal for washing windows. I use a few sheets of these towels with cleaning liquid to get the dirt off the window, then use a single microfiber cloth for a final dry and polish. The used towels are rinsed and set aside to dry for the next task. I can usually get 4 or 5 uses out of a single towel before it starts to shred up.<br /><br />My only quibble is that I don't care for the graphics printed on the towels. They aren't bad looking, just unnecessary. Other than that, no complaints. They work well, last a good amount of time, eliminate the waste of using one-time use paper towels, and are a good value compared to other similar towels (as well compared with  conventional paper towels since one of these towels can take the place of many one-time use paper towels).",[],B08BZ9NMJT,B08BZ9NMJT,AG63W2BMC4HRP76AMS36AYY64AHA,2020-09-18 12:10:12.853,0,False,2889,"('NEGATIVE', 0.7936387658119202)",NEGATIVE,0.7936387658119202
4,Good quality mop; bucket lacks some needed features,"Overall, this is a pretty decent mop and bucket set.  The mop is excellent. The pole is metal, and the sections thread together well. The threaded portion is recessed into each section, making for a very durable, solid connection that won't come apart or loosen when using the mop. The mop head is not threaded, but it has a good quality snap button attachment.  The only mop-related complaint I have is that the point of attachment between the pole and the mop head is plastic. It's a decent quality, thick plastic, but metal would have been nice since that's a strain point on the mop.<br /><br />The mop head covers are of good quality, and attach well with Velcro to the mop head. Two pads are provided in the set. While they can be machine washed, it's better to hand wash them and let them air dry while laid flat. It reduces the wear and tear that the pads get in a washing machine.<br /><br />The bucket design could have been better. It is smaller than another similar product that I have which is actually a positive, since it weighs less when full of water. However, it lacks some key convenience features, such as a pop-open drain at the base. It is also not possible to remove the top to clean out the bucket well after use. The overall build quality of the bucket is somewhat lightweight, especially the handle. It lacks the heft and durability of other similar products.<br /><br />While the bucket issues brings my score to 4 stars, this is still a very good performing set. It's easy to get the mop head into the bucket since the mop head has a spring that allows it to automatically fold vertically so it can be inserted into the bucket. The ""squeegee"" on the dry side does a good job of wringing out the water. The ability to have a wet and a dry side to the bucket makes mopping quicker, easier, and results in a better job.<br /><br />Not perfect, but a decent value for the price.",[],B0878RRKZ2,B0878RRKZ2,AG63W2BMC4HRP76AMS36AYY64AHA,2020-08-27 03:09:48.419,0,False,2890,"('POSITIVE', 0.9540249705314636)",POSITIVE,0.9540249705314636
5,Good fit; effective design,"No complaints at all about these generic replacement heads for a Sonicare. They fit well on my Sonicare -- not so tight that they are difficult to get on or off, and not so loose that they come off too easily. The fit is pretty much the same as the authentic Sonicare brushes.<br /><br />Although these are described as being soft, I would rate the bristles as medium (or perhaps medium/soft). The bristles are definitely harder than the Sonicare Ultra Soft version, but are not as hard as the Sonicare regular brushes. I would have preferred that they be just a tad softer than they are, but they are not so hard as to cause any notable gum irritation. The oblong head shape is good for getting at the gum line and reaching molars.<br /><br />The set of 8 come in a single box, with each brush individually sealed in a plastic pouch. Plus, there's a cap over the end of each brush. I much prefer this type of packaging versus the blister pack method used by other generic replacement heads. It's easier to deal with and creates less packaging waste.<br /><br />No significant complaints about these -- good value for the price.",[],B0883G8V19,B0883G8V19,AG63W2BMC4HRP76AMS36AYY64AHA,2020-07-12 19:29:01.247,0,False,2891,"('NEGATIVE', 0.9277937412261963)",NEGATIVE,0.9277937412261963
5,"Some limitations, but overall a good compostable bag","These are nicely done compostable bags. The material is thick enough to deal with an acceptable load (e.g., full, but not overstuffed full) without breaking. They are sized fine for a 13 gallon container. It would have been nice to have an extra inch or so of length for an even better fit, but as-is I'm finding them to fit without any significant issue provided they are placed carefully when initially put into the can.<br /><br />If you were to compare these to conventional plastic bags with regard to strength, ability to stretch and puncture resistance, these would clearly come up short. But they are not plastic bags, they are compostable bags. On that basis, they are very well done, with enough strength to be useful but still retain the ability to break down.<br /><br />They come on a single roll with perforations between each bag. I've not had any problems tearing off the bags without damaging them. There are no ties, either provided separately or built into the top of the bag. Again, that's not a con since these are compostable rather than traditional bags.<br /><br />Very helpful to have when dealing with compostable material or even run-of-the-mill trash.

The box board is thick enough to feel substantial without looking (or feeling) like they are boxes for mailing. The gold color is glossy and even. They ship flat and are easy to fold into a box. I reinforce the bottom seam with some tape to keep it secure, but using tape is not essential.<br /><br />They are sized well to use as boxes to hold home-made chocolates, candy, cookies and the like, and the gold color gives it a distinctive look.

3,"Decent, but not outstanding with regard to strains and potency; average value","This is a decent, but not outstanding probiotic supplement. It contains only 4 strains (3 Lactobacillus strains and one Bifidobacterium strain) which is on the low end. More significantly, it does not indicate on the ingredients how much of each strain is in the mix. That's a notable shortcoming since it could be heavily weighed on just one strain.<br /><br />The capsules themselves are easy to swallow. The dosage is 2 caps per serving. Thus, the claimed 40 billion CFU potency applies to using 2 caps per day. Each cap has a potency of 20 billion CFUs, making this on the high end of the price scale when you compare it with how long it will last.  The bottle states that the potency listed is at the time of manufacture (which is the usual situation) and that the potency should remain at at least 10 billion CFU per cap prior to the best-by date (which for a bottle received in June 2020 is Aug 2021).<br /><br />It works as well as other probiotics for me. I've not experienced any significant side effects, such as gas or bloating. However, when taking all factors into consideration, it's just an average (3 star) product. The use of only 4 strains, not providing concentration levels for the strains, and requiring 2 caps to hit the claimed 40 billion CFU potency make this only an average value compared with other probiotics.",[],B07WCQZNX2,B07WCQZNX2,AG63W2BMC4HRP76AMS36AYY64AHA,2020-06-19 11:52:56.073,1,False,2894,"('NEGATIVE', 0.9894457459449768)",NEGATIVE,0.9894457459449768

It works much better than pad cotton, cotton bacon, or other rope style cotton (such as the Fantasea cotton on Amazon). It can get packed tightly against the mesh to prevent hot spots, but still wicks very well.<br /><br />It can also be used for pretty much any other wicking situation but there's no significant difference between this and other cottons for those situations.

5,The best tasting way to take probiotics,"I've been using probiotics for years and have appreciated the benefits. This version didn't offer any significantly different benefits in terms of probiotic activity for me, but it does come with one big plus: they taste great!<br /><br />I normally use pills for probiotics since the chews I've tried were not all that appealing in terms of taste. These are much different -- they are round balls about the same size as a typical malted milk ball. It has a waxy coating so it does not melt in your hand. The dark chocolate taste is excellent. It does not have the same texture as actual chocolate (it's a bit more grainy), but it is very tasty.<br /><br />Probiotics are great to keep everything running smoothly in your gut, and this is the best tasting option I've come across. The only downside is that the cost per dose is higher than many of the capsule-based probiotics.

The material is soft throughout, without any hard edges that can dig into your skin. The three Velcro straps are made of a different type of Velcro than my other braces. Instead of a thick strap with large ""teeth"" that latch onto the hook portion, this has a very thin strap that keeps the bulkiness way down. But, even though the straps are thin, they are still very secure. In fact, it can be hard to unstrap this unless you get a really strong grip on the strap.<br /><br />The build quality is excellent. All the stitching it tight and even, and everything is put together in a very secure manner. This gives me a lot of confidence that this will stand up to a lot of use.<br /><br />It's made of nylon and spandex, and can be washed (hand wash only).<br /><br />All in all, this is an excellent brace.

4,Soothing but with an unusual taste,"The main “cold fighting” ingredient in this is Echinacea which, for some people, has been shown to help fight colds. I’ve taken it in the past in pill format with mixed results – sometimes it seems to help; other times not so much.<br /><br />This is another way to get your Echinacea along with other herbs. The ingredients are:<br /><br />Echinacea purpuera herb<br />red root<br />green tea leaf<br />elderberry fruit<br />thyme herb<br />red clover herb<br />myrrh gum<br /><br />It’s in a base of vegetable glycerin and water, which gives it a syrupy consistency. On the plus side, that can help soothe your throat. On the downside, the taste, to me, was only semi-appealing. It’s not bad or medicinal tasting, just odd – sort of a semi-spicy taste that lingers on your tongue.<br /><br />The dosage is 1ml (25 drops) 1 to 2 times per day. I like that it comes in a glass bottle with a good quality dropper rather than plastic. However, the country of manufacture is not listed nor is the concentration of the various herbs in it.<br /><br />I can’t give it a strong recommendation since the taste is so unusual. It’s one of those items that you’re either going to find tasty or really dislike. But I found the taste odd but interesting, so I’ll give it 3.5 stars, rounded up to 4 since it did soothe my throat.<br /><br />Worth a try but, as with any herbal remedy, don’t expect your cold symptoms to magically disappear.<br />[Sample provided for review]",[],B007P63SCE,B007P63SCE,AG63W2BMC4HRP76AMS36AYY64AHA,2014-01-29 01:03:03.000,9,False,2901,"('NEGATIVE', 0.6986039876937866)",NEGATIVE,0.6986039876937866

I think some scents are lighter than others.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61N8X8ic+1L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61N8X8ic+1L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61N8X8ic+1L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61gOvCu-38L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61gOvCu-38L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61gOvCu-38L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71-cwkoOJ+L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71-cwkoOJ+L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71-cwkoOJ+L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09NLXBQ2M,B09NLXBQ2M,AEO7XXGLQE7IJOJZ2CQ6NXEHGFKQ,2022-02-13 22:23:34.404,0,False,2905,"('POSITIVE', 0.9986655712127686)",POSITIVE,0.9986655712127686
4,Nice Beard Grooming Set,Every beard is different and I wish I had one like Chris Stapleton but unfortunately I don't. I like the Groomed and Tailored Beard Set but my beard is not quite there yet. I love the quality of the items and especially like the scissors. The three tools come in a cloth bag.,[],B0BB1FJ7HW,B0BB1FJ7HW,AFRC4WUGDVZMUHA7SZYESPFJEXYQ,2023-03-07 03:01:47.154,0,False,2906,"('POSITIVE', 0.617759644985199)",POSITIVE,0.617759644985199
4,Great way to clean the inside part of the teeth,I've always made it a point to clean my dogs teeth since it's good for them and dental cleanings are very expensive. I've used dog toothbrushes and finger cloth brushes before but never a dual silicone finger setup like this. I never cleaned the inside of the teeth but only the outer sides. The dual finger brush does make it easier to clean the inside teeth and fortunately my dog is use to me having my fingers in her mouth. I'm sure this might not work for many but it does work okay for me and my situation.,[],B0BMX6LJVJ,B0BTBDLVF3,AFRC4WUGDVZMUHA7SZYESPFJEXYQ,2022-12-21 02:32:41.953,0,False,2907,"('POSITIVE', 0.9920735955238342)",POSITIVE,0.9920735955238342
3,Too soft,"I have very sensitive gums so this was the first time using this type of toothbrush. I normally use a soft head toothbrush, but this toothbrush was too soft and thick. I wasn't able to brush my back molars properly.  I wanted to like it but I don't feel confident this brush was cleaning my teeth well enough.",[],B0BNWKL5TV,B0BNWKL5TV,AFRC4WUGDVZMUHA7SZYESPFJEXYQ,2022-12-19 01:55:26.341,0,False,2908,"('NEGATIVE', 0.9977477192878723)",NEGATIVE,0.9977477192878723
4,Good Compression with added Knee Support,"I got this to help support my weak knee and get the benefits of the compression sleeve. I didn't want to wear two separate items when everything can be had it this one item. The sleeve is tight but I know that's the compression working. Once on, it's comfortable and I don't feel any discomfort. Wished it came in a 2-pack so my legs feel balanced but happy with it giving my one weaker knee support.",[],B0BCWB11GX,B0BCWB11GX,AFRC4WUGDVZMUHA7SZYESPFJEXYQ,2022-11-25 05:29:28.742,0,False,2909,"('POSITIVE', 0.9943846464157104)",POSITIVE,0.9943846464157104
5,Good Quality Broccoli Powder,"I enjoy fresh and steamed broccoli and have noticed that usually, the next day after eating a good amount of broccoli, I feel and look better.  I think there's something in broccoli that really tunes my engine.  So, when this package of broccoli powder came up on my list of items I could review I wanted to try it.  I like it.  I mix it with some wheatgrass powder or other super foods (like to include a sweet one for flavor) and water, mix thoroughly and drink it down.  It's not something to write home about, but I like it well enough and I feel I'm getting some good nutrition.  This powder seems to be fresh and will puff out of the envelope if you're not careful with it.",[],B09C7QLB26,B09C7QLB26,AEYVPPWR4CIKWX4BGYKCBCDL2CZQ,2022-03-07 16:03:57.268,0,False,2910,"('POSITIVE', 0.998250424861908)",POSITIVE,0.998250424861908
3,Small Amount of Oregano Oil per Tube,"Oil of oregano is a very potent anti-viral and anti-bacterial.  I've got oregano oil in a liquid (bottle) and in softgels.  I can't tolerate the liquid unless it's diluted because it's so hot.  These little tubes of oregano oil are convenient and taste good, but you only get 50mg of oregano oil per tube.  One softgel of oregano oil usually delivers about 150mg.  If you don't want that much then these tubes are good alternative.  I found that though they taste good, getting all the oil out of the tube was impossible.  There's always an amount left in the bottom.",[],B09QRB7G5J,B09QRB7G5J,AEYVPPWR4CIKWX4BGYKCBCDL2CZQ,2022-03-07 14:28:05.564,0,False,2911,"('NEGATIVE', 0.9745527505874634)",NEGATIVE,0.9745527505874634
3,Pretty but Little Scent,"I don't really see the advantage of ""travel size"" since all the other shower steamers I've reviewed were individually wrapped in plastic.  But, nonetheless these are easy to toss into a suitcase or bag for trips.  I used two of them at the same time yesterday in the shower and still couldn't really detect much scent.  They're pretty to watch dissolving but as far as scent goes there's not very much.  These come in a very good quality box with a bow, ready for gifting.",[],B09NLXBQ2M,B09NLXBQ2M,AEYVPPWR4CIKWX4BGYKCBCDL2CZQ,2022-02-17 16:08:20.361,0,False,2912,"('POSITIVE', 0.8447125554084778)",POSITIVE,0.8447125554084778
5,Seems to be a Good Sleep Product,"This Freshcap Unwind instant drink mix tastes very good.  It's slightly sweet and no where near being too sweet.  Some people may want to add a little more sweetener to it.  I mixed up a tube in some boiling water and it completely dissolved leaving no mushroom sediment at the bottom of my cup.  It nearly has the color of coffee and when I added a little cream to it it looked exactly like coffee and even sort of mimics the taste of coffee but without the caffeine.  The product page says it contains 1000 mg of dual mix (I guess that means Reishi and Chaga) but it doesn't say per serving.  Nor does it say anything on the box about how many mgs you are getting per serving.  I'm assuming that you get 1000 mg of Reishi and Chaga per tube.  I looked at a couple of bottles of mushroom capsules I have and the label said two capsules delivered 1000 mg and so I guess one tube also contains 1000 mg.  Overall I think this is a good product, especially useful right before bedtime to promote a better night's sleep, and it tastes good too.",[],B08TM6CW84,B08TM6CW84,AEYVPPWR4CIKWX4BGYKCBCDL2CZQ,2022-02-15 18:41:55.941,0,False,2913,"('POSITIVE', 0.9883911609649658)",POSITIVE,0.9883911609649658
5,Very Good Supplement,"I've been consuming fulvic and humic acids pretty much daily for the past couple of years in a shilajit form, which is dark, sometimes very thick and it never tastes good by itself.  So, when I saw Trace Minerals humic and fulvic acid on my list of items I could review I wanted to try it.  I've purchased several Trace Mineral product before, mainly their concentrated trace mineral drops and have found them to be very good quality.  I think this Trace Mineral Liquid Gut Health is a very good product and delivers some fulvic and humic acids that are so good for health and so rare to find in the basic American diet.  This is not as concentrated as what you get in shilajit, but it's a big bottle, one teaspoon is the daily dose, and it has no flavor.  It tastes like water.  I think this is a very good supplement though I don't know if it will help with gut health or not but is still a healthy supplement. Shilajit can be very expensive (a couple of hundred dollars depending on the quality) but it contains a LOT of trace minerals.  But for a much less expensive substitute I think the Trace Minerals is a good choice.",[],B09Q9CYZWF,B09Q9CYZWF,AEYVPPWR4CIKWX4BGYKCBCDL2CZQ,2022-02-05 19:31:42.179,9,False,2914,"('POSITIVE', 0.9649540185928345)",POSITIVE,0.9649540185928345

They work great and get my teeth nice and clean.,[],B09G5W6YMC,B09G5W6YMC,AEYVPPWR4CIKWX4BGYKCBCDL2CZQ,2022-01-05 23:07:10.353,0,False,2915,"('POSITIVE', 0.9314930438995361)",POSITIVE,0.9314930438995361
5,Excellent Smelling Salts,"The last time I ever smelled smelling salts was when I was a kid and another kid in the neighborhood had a bottle of them for some reason.  We all smelled it and I haven't forgotten how strong it smelled.  These Westside Barbell smelling salts are just as strong.  However this time, I used the technique I learned in chemistry class in college which was NOT to stick my nose right over the flask, beaker or whatever container, but to hold it out from my face and waft the air over it with my hand towards my snout.  These are very good smelling salts.",[],B09D5K7CLY,B09D5P75MN,AEYVPPWR4CIKWX4BGYKCBCDL2CZQ,2021-11-30 15:44:43.132,0,False,2916,"('POSITIVE', 0.9995551705360413)",POSITIVE,0.9995551705360413

5,Contains Quercetin,"I've done some research on the health benefits of fisetin but can't really find a lot about it.  It hasn't had many studies and the results of the ones done weren't very conclusive.  But, the reason I selected this product for review was not for the fisetin content but the quercetin.  Quercetin is absolutely wonderful at getting zinc into cells to fight off and kill viruses.  It really goes very well with vitamin C, D3 and zinc and I take all of those daily.",[],B0937C7QPH,B0937C7QPH,AEYVPPWR4CIKWX4BGYKCBCDL2CZQ,2021-09-28 17:17:45.287,0,False,2918,"('POSITIVE', 0.9992585778236389)",POSITIVE,0.9992585778236389
4,Good Supplement - contains Quercetin,"I kind of consider this supplement as a back-up to my other supplements and vitamins because although it contains very good things, it doesn't contain some of them in high enough quantities for me.  For instance, I normally take at least 250mcg D3 10,000 IU) daily, and this supplement only contains 3.3 mcg which is a mere fraction and that requires 2 capsules.  But, I like a lot that it contains 167 mg of quercetin, and 167 mg of elderberry, both extremely important in keeping one's immune system strong and healthy.  Overall, I think this is a very good supplement for the immune system but more D3, C, and zinc should be taken along with this.",[],B093ZBSBP2,B093ZBSBP2,AEYVPPWR4CIKWX4BGYKCBCDL2CZQ,2021-09-13 17:41:53.342,0,False,2919,"('NEGATIVE', 0.9855973124504089)",NEGATIVE,0.9855973124504089
5,Good Combo Supplement,"I think this is a very good D3/K2 supplement. It seems to be very reasonably priced (as of this review a bottle of 60 veggie caps costs $16.19 giving you a 3 month supply). One capsule delivers 125 mcg of D3 and 100 mcg  of vitamin K2. 210 mg calcium is also included which is only 16% DV. I take at least 5000 IU of D3 each day and usually more since it is such a powerful anti-viral and is so good for brain health. And in combination with K2, needed calcium is stored in bones and being 63, I don't want to get soft or brittle bones as I age. I think this is a very good supplement.",[],B098ZHL7VW,B098ZHL7VW,AEYVPPWR4CIKWX4BGYKCBCDL2CZQ,2021-08-19 21:23:35.157,0,False,2920,"('POSITIVE', 0.9907048344612122)",POSITIVE,0.9907048344612122
4,Soft and Pliable Earplugs,"These foam earplugs are easy to use and they expand inside your ears.  But, I would never rely exclusively on these for really loud sounds like gun shots.  I think they might be fine for car races (probably not Nascar - really loud), or to wear to block out some sounds while trying to get to sleep.  I have one in each ear right now, fully expanded and I can easily hear sounds around me so I can't really tell if they would reduce loud sounds or not. They seem to be made out the regular foamy material a lot of ear plugs are made out of and they come very well packaged and you get 3 pairs in one plastic box for a total of 12 pairs.",[],B095BZZ6JQ,B095BZZ6JQ,AEYVPPWR4CIKWX4BGYKCBCDL2CZQ,2021-08-08 17:28:44.284,0,False,2921,"('POSITIVE', 0.9868749976158142)",POSITIVE,0.9868749976158142
5,Excellent Liquid Liposomal Vitamin C,All of the liquid liposomal vitamin C products that I've reviewed have all had a strong flavor - not bad but some people might like to dilute in water or something. I take it straight out of the bottle but the sweetened citrus flavoring is strong. I most definitely prefer a liposomal form of vitamin C whether it's capsules or liquid. Liposomal vitamin C stays in your system much longer than the water soluble ascorbic acid which is excreted quickly by the body. Liposomal means the ascorbic acid is wrapped in a fat blanket (sunflower oil) and is therefore carried much further and longer in your system fighting cold and flu viruses. This bottle of liposomal vitamin C is nearly the same as all the others I've reviewed so there's a lot of them to choose from. I can find nothing negative to say about this liquid liposomal vitamin C.,[],B0921NRWRF,B0921NRWRF,AEYVPPWR4CIKWX4BGYKCBCDL2CZQ,2021-07-29 15:43:14.355,0,False,2922,"('NEGATIVE', 0.7384110689163208)",NEGATIVE,0.7384110689163208
5,Excellent Readers,I really like these blue light blocking reading glasses.  They are very well constructed and not cheap looking like some other readers I've reviewed.

These come with a cleaning cloth and hard shell case.,[],B095PBTFS9,B095PBTFS9,AEYVPPWR4CIKWX4BGYKCBCDL2CZQ,2021-07-22 18:56:24.413,0,False,2923,"('POSITIVE', 0.9996860027313232)",POSITIVE,0.9996860027313232

I don't know how long it will hold a charge but my other two that are very similar hold a charge for a long time.  I don't use any electronic facial devices except for this one and I think it does a good job at gently loosening up dead skin cells.,[],B08R8JN83S,B08R8JN83S,AEYVPPWR4CIKWX4BGYKCBCDL2CZQ,2021-06-12 17:00:27.730,0,False,2926,"('POSITIVE', 0.9947652816772461)",POSITIVE,0.9947652816772461

4,Excellent Magnesium but Very Pricey,"This supplement is in the form of magnesium glycinate. It is used mostly for helping one get to sleep. It relaxes the muscles, lowers blood pressure and basically prepares the body for sleep. I've taken magnesium glycinate off and on for years to help me get to sleep and it usually does the trick.  The type of magnesium (magnesium glycinate) is highly absorbable and is one of the best forms to take.  However, I think this bottle of 60 capsules (a one month supply for $29.99 as of this review) is too expensive.  I've seen it for a lot less than $29.99.",[],B092FT49F9,B092FT49F9,AEYVPPWR4CIKWX4BGYKCBCDL2CZQ,2021-06-01 15:07:00.915,0,False,2928,"('POSITIVE', 0.7783569097518921)",POSITIVE,0.7783569097518921
5,Excellent Lions Mane Supplement,"I find this lion's mane powder in capsules to be very good quality. It has no taste that I can detect. I don't like swallowing pills so I open the capsules and dump the lions mane powder into another container and then add it to my coffee in loose form. The recommended dosage is 2 capsules/day and that's about the scooped amount I put in my coffee. Lions mane has many healthy benefits and my husband and I have been taking a blend of various mushroom powders, including lion's mane everyday for the past couple of years and both of us have not been the least bit sick since starting that.

That said, I think these capsules are good quality and they have not given me any adverse side effects. I have to be careful what I ingest lest I get a serious bout of gastric distress going.

5,Very Good Wipes,As of this review I don't know how much these clean wipes costs.  I think they do a good job of cleaning and are about the same size as a full sized Kleenex but much stronger and can be used multiple times.  I think the idea is that they don't shed any fibers which is great for places where tiny fibers can interfere with sensitive equipment - electronics labs and the situations given on the product page.,[],B08KGTL2QG,B08KGTL2QG,AEYVPPWR4CIKWX4BGYKCBCDL2CZQ,2021-04-15 16:27:14.352,0,False,2932,"('NEGATIVE', 0.9646596312522888)",NEGATIVE,0.9646596312522888
4,Comes in Capsule and Powder Forms,"I've tried this supplement in capsule and in powder form.  I think I like the capsule form better because the powder tastes kind of fishy and has no sweet (but it's not bitter either).  These capsules cost $119.95 as of this review and the powder is about ten dollars more.  Both are a one month supply.  However, 3 capsules/day is the recommended dosage and I'm not fond of swallowing pills.  I really wish I could say, ""Wow! This has dramatically improved my cognitive abilities"" but I can't.  I think I'm the wrong person to test it out since my cognitive abilities are already pretty darn good.  But, I've only been taking it as directed for a little over two weeks and these things often take more time than that.  The directions on the side of the powder container say to take a cognitive test before starting and then after 30 days take another one to see how well your cognitive skills have improved.  I don't have that much time to wait before I can write a review.

I've reviewed other high quality collagens that cost less and were also flavorless.  That said, I think this is a good collagen product for collagens I and III.  It dissolves well in liquids and has no taste that I can detect.  I've been taking collagen on a daily basis for about 8 months and have finally started to notice improvement in the skin on my arms and face.

I have reviewed several other red superfood powders and I don't recall any of them costing that much.  I have several red superfood mixes that contain many of the same ingredients as this but the cost is much less.  That said, I think this is an excellent mix, it has a lot of very good ingredients that are very beneficial for good health,  it dissolves well with little clumping, the color is pretty and the flavor is good.

5,Inexpensive and Very Useful,"As of this review this electric candle lighter costs $7.99, which I think is a reasonable price for it.  It works well but is not as durably constructed as some other ones that I've reviewed.  However, it works very well and is nice to have when needing to light candles or even the gas ignitor on a stove.  It comes with a USB cord for charging, but the cord I got wouldn't fit into the port on the end of the lighter.  But, since most of us have about 1,000 of USB cords lying around you will find another to fit if yours also doesn't fit.  I'm using another cord and all is well.  Also, I like that it has a small slide switch on the end of the lighter that has to be in the ""on"" position before it will work.  I just think that makes it a little safer in case a child should play with it.",[],B08QMQKFH6,B08QMQKFH6,AEYVPPWR4CIKWX4BGYKCBCDL2CZQ,2021-04-03 00:02:50.982,0,False,2936,"('POSITIVE', 0.9560061693191528)",POSITIVE,0.9560061693191528

I've been using sensitive toothpastes for years so when this one came up on my list of items I could review I decided to try it.  The only thing I don't like about it is that it contains fluoride since I'm trying to eliminate fluoride from my diet as much as possible.  I've used the Spotlight sensitive toothpaste twice a day for about a week and if my teeth were going to react to it they would have by now.  I have not had any sensitivity issues with this toothpaste.  Also, it tastes fine and my teeth really feel nice and clean afterwards.

3,Pricey for 70grams From One Source,"These travel packs only contain collagen from one source - bovine and they are very pricey.  As of this review 7 travel packs of 10 grams each costs nearly $20.00.  I don't think the convenience of having 10 grams of collagen in a pack is worth all the extra money.  I have reviewed a lot of collagen products and the latest one I've reviewed only costs $24.95 for 324 grams.  And it contains collagen from 5 different sources. The ELAINE collagen only contains bovine collagen.  All that said, it mixes in with my hot coffee completely and I couldn't even tell that it was there.  It's totally flavorless and did not clump at all.",[],B08L8D2XQF,B08L8D2XQF,AEYVPPWR4CIKWX4BGYKCBCDL2CZQ,2021-03-12 18:23:58.693,0,False,2938,"('NEGATIVE', 0.9894596338272095)",NEGATIVE,0.9894596338272095
5,Good Bone Broth Powder,"The absolute best bone broth is that which you make yourself using cracked bones and boiling them for several hours.  Drain and filter and freeze what you don't use right away.  However, that is time consuming and messy.  Though I know I get the best quality bone broth by making it myself, a powder is so nice and easy.  I've added this powder it to soup stock and into my meatloaf recipe.  It's savory and not sweet or chocolate flavored (a lot of them are and I really get tired of chocolate everything) and can be added to a lot of dishes or drunk as is mixed with hot water.

These drops contain B2, B3, B5, B6 and B12 which make for a very good complex.  I have found from personal experience over the past few years, that a high daily dose of B12 significantly improves my cognitive abilities.  I haven't had brain fog in a long time and my memory is sharp when I take a good B complex, especially B12.  I think these are excellent drops though they aren't as candy flavored as some others but they don't taste bad either.

I'm kind of sorry I selected this product for review because after reading up on it I don't think it's very ethically sourced. And it's pricey too.

D3 is fat soluble and should stay in your system longer.  I think one small capsule/day is plenty, at least for me.  The bottle is too big for the quantity because it looks like the bottle is nearly empty but it contains 60 little vitamin D3 pills.

Our house is kind of cold and it has remained a nice, clear and easy to use liquid.  It's easy to pump out and apply.  I can't say it's the best moisturizer I've ever used because coconut oil is naturally a little dehydrating.  I still like it though and have been using this oil everyday after showering.

3,"Good Vitamins, Fishy Flavor","Normally I just love gummy vitamins but these don't taste very good.  I like the vitamins and omega-3's they contain, all that is very good.  They just don't taste good.  I immediately get a fishy flavor (got to be from the algae they are made from) followed by some serious tartness.  Though they are still palatable, why consume these when there are other gummy vitamins that are just as good and taste a lot better?

Taking two of these is a good way to start the day by giving your immune system a jump start against cold and flu viruses.

And this is just a few of it's health benefits.  The dosage is two capsule per day which delivers 700 mg of nigella sativa extract.  I think this is a great supplement to keep in your medicinal arsenal along with Oregano oil and Olive leaf extract. This is one of few nigella sativa powders I've reviewed but I find it to be as good as, and maybe better than black seed oil.  It costs more than black seed oil.  As of this review one bottle of 60 nigella sativa powder capsules costs nearly $40.00.

5,Very Good Elderberry Supplement,"These elderberry gummies are very near the top of my list of favorite elderberry gummies.  These taste very good but my main reason for liking them so much is that they include propolis, echinacea and vitamin C.  These don't have any zinc and I'm glad of that because it seems like zinc is included in so many other supplements.

Besides waging serious war with the moths, I've placed a lot of food items in these smell-proof bags in the hopes if there are any moths left that we didn't eradicate that they will not be able to smell the food through the bags and thus burrow into them.  So far it seems to be working but we also having found any moths stuck to the fly strips we hung up in there either so that's a good sign we might have gotten them all.

But for home use I'd rather have my big jug of liquid laundry detergent.  I've used several of these and they seem to clean clothes just fine and don't leave any perfume scent behind on them.  However, I have to use 3 sheets at a time since my laundry loads are big.  At that rate, I only get about 10 or 11 loads done and that just isn't all the economical since one box costs $10.59.  I can get a big jug of liquid for about that much money.

I'm 62 and play very competitive tennis, singles and doubles against opponents less than half my age and I often win.  I am a true believer in the miracle of Golden Paste as my previously super sore and creaky knees have been transformed into those of a 25 year old's - no kidding.  Please google ""golden paste"" and see how easy it is to make at home and give it a try.

It mixes well with plain water though it seems to settle out a little bit if left to sit in the glass for a while.  The flavor is not all that good - it has a strong, almost bitter flavor that I don't really care for.

It mixes up nicely in water and that's the only way I've been drinking it so far.  I kind of got off of smoothies but will try some in one eventually.  The bag is big with a lot of servings.

I have tried and reviewed a LOT of electrolytes - some I like a lot like this one and others that I save for when it's cold outside and I don't sweat much.  This Pickleball electrolyte is my first choice because it contains more potassium, sodium and magnesium than any of the others that I have.  These packets make it easy to take some along in my tennis bag and mix up a bottle when I feel I need it.

I have other forms of bone marrow supplements that I like better such as a thick gravy kind that is already seasoned and all I have to do is spoon it into a casserole, meatloaf, soup, etc.... and stir it in before cooking it.

5,Excellent Liposomal Vitamin C,"I have purchased a lot of bottles of Liposomal Vitamin C but of other brands because of Covid-19. My whole family takes liposomal vitamin C instead of regular vitamin C for one main reason. Liposomal vitamin C stays in your system much longer and is not excreted or used up nearly as quickly as regular ascorbic acid type vitamin C, which is what most people take. The liposomal type is best because it will stay in your system to continue giving protection from viruses. I learned of liposomal from watching health oriented Youtube videos. This brand is every bit as good as the other brands I've taken and and you need no less that 1500 mg each day, and we take even more. This type of vitamin C costs more, but it's definitely worth the extra money.

The bag says one serving is 2g of elderberry powder but says nothing about any other ingredients such as vitamins.  All that information is on the product page.

3,Use as a BACKUP Supplement Only,"This supplement is a good BACKUP to what you are already taking to prevent getting the flu and keeping your immune system healthy.  I say that because these aren't ordinary times with Covid-19, and extra supplements are necessary.  I like some of ingredients in this supplement but wish the vitamin C had been liposomal and not ascorbic acid.  The zinc is in the form of zinc oxide, which is the least bioavailable.  Most of it won't be utilized by your body.  All the other ingredients are good and I always like to see Elderberry included since it is a powerful anti-oxidant and virus buster.  I take over 1500 mg liposomal vitamin C each day plus extra zinc (citrate/gluconate) so I don't think the 180mg of vitamin C (in this supplement) will do anything to help your immune system fight off Covid.  I'm giving it 3 stars and think that is being generous.",[],B086MC3SJH,B086MC3SJH,AEYVPPWR4CIKWX4BGYKCBCDL2CZQ,2020-06-05 16:01:44.486,0,False,2964,"('POSITIVE', 0.9729536771774292)",POSITIVE,0.9729536771774292

I washed it once in the machine and it did o.k. but I decided to spray it all over with this spray.  It went on fine.  The family said it had a smell but I could barely detect it.

When I saw it I instantly selected it because I know that Chlorella is an excellent green superfood. I love superfoods and consume them often. This one is just Chlorella with no Spirulina added, but if you want both in a capsule it's easy to find here on Amazon. If it's only Chlorella you're interested in this is a great way to take it. I like both the powdered and capsule forms. I like the powder for my smoothies but sometimes I don't want a smoothie and the capsules are a great alternative.

I've knows about the wonderful health benefits of Chaga for some time, but after reading about Shilajit I knew I wanted more so I have put some on my wish list to order later when this runs low.

I have tasted these electrolyte drops and they taste fine in water, but I haven't been able to test it out on a hot court since it's still winter. But, looking at the ingredients list it seems to have everything I need and more. I especially like the extra potassium it contains.

No way would I buy this especially for the turmeric content.  I have bags of turmeric powder (can be found at a regular grocery store) and about a billion capsules of turmeric supplement and I know it's cheap to buy.  I also have a lot of holly basil and astaxanthin to take anytime I need it.

I don't know why they have to be so sweet, I usually add lime/lemon juice to them to cut the sweet.  That said, I play two hard sets of singles yesterday in the hot sun and had my water bottle filled with this energy booster.  I felt o.k. for the most part.

I can still take a shower but the shower spray is not as diffuse as before.  Installing the filter was basically a no-brainer.  Take off shower head, install filter apparatus (even plumbing tape is included), put shower head back on.

4,Very Good but Sweet,I drank this yesterday as directed on the side of the container and I seemed to have more energy than I thought I would at my evening tennis practice.  I had worked out pretty hard using the tennis ball machine earlier that day and was kind of dragging before tennis practice time.  I drank a full 8 oz of water with one scoopful of Gen One Nutrition-Intramino Intra-Workout BCAA Amino Acids Powder and I really did feel pretty good and played well at practice.  I wasn't even very tired when I got home and our coach had us doing conditioning drills.  The flavor was sort of coconut-like and sweet.  I wish it was not so sweet but it seems that most of these type powders just load up on sweetness.  It dissolved well in water and I didn't see any clumps.  I like this but will have to add some lemon juice to it next time to tone down the sweet.,[],B0792DJZNW,B0792DJZNW,AEYVPPWR4CIKWX4BGYKCBCDL2CZQ,2019-04-12 16:53:24.088,0,False,3007,"('POSITIVE', 0.9949238896369934)",POSITIVE,0.9949238896369934
4,Good Maca Powder,"I add a scoopful of Maca powder and a scoopful of Amalaki powder to my smoothies as extras.  My main ingredients are my green superfood powders, banana,milk kefir, protein powder and whatever else I have that I want to toss in.  I haven't had any adverse reaction from the Maca powder and from what I've read it's supposed to help with a lot of various ailments - menopausal problems being what I am most interested in, though I can't really tell if my hot flashes are decreasing or not.  And I can't really detect any taste or weird texture since it's getting mixed up with other things, but some people sprinkle it on yogurt, oatmeal, salads, etc....straight out of the package.

4,Really Good in Smoothies,"I've never even heard of Amalaki until this powder came up for review.  I selected it because I really love these types of things and am always looking for something extra and good, to add to my daily smoothies.  I use a lot of super food powders because I really do feel better after consuming them.  I added a scoopful of Amalaki powder to my regular smoothie and it actually gave it a better flavor.  They had always been a little overly-sweet and the Amalaki powder really balanced it out well.  I read that Amalaki fruit is very high in vitamin C and is supposed to be very good for the digestive system.  My digestive system can give me some serious grief at times and is the main reason I started making my own milk kefir, kombucha and other fermented foods to get the natural probiotics they contain.  So far, I have not had any gastic problems drinking my smoothies containing Amalaki and I can only hope it helps in the ways it has been reported to do so.",[],B07J3F4KLJ,B07XVVVB8W,AEYVPPWR4CIKWX4BGYKCBCDL2CZQ,2019-03-15 10:41:55.880,0,False,3009,"('POSITIVE', 0.9923877716064453)",POSITIVE,0.9923877716064453
4,Best in a Smoothie,"I mixed a heaping scoopful in some cold, filtered water and it took some stirring but finally seemed to dissolve.  It turned the water a beautiful cherry red but it did not taste like cherries.  It tastes a lot like beets (since beets are the primary ingredient) and I could detect the flavor of the soil they were grown in.  I've grown organic beets in my raised beds and I never could get the dirt taste completely out of them so I'm not complaining.  As far as sweetness goes, there was very little despite it being sweetened with Stevia.  I will be putting this into my smoothies and kefir smoothies from now on since it's flavor is not all that good but the ingredients are top notch.",[],B07J3F4V1W,B07XVVVB8W,AEYVPPWR4CIKWX4BGYKCBCDL2CZQ,2019-01-07 15:41:09.579,1,False,3010,"('POSITIVE', 0.9911983609199524)",POSITIVE,0.9911983609199524
5,Good Electrolytes,"We always keep electrolytes of various brands and flavors not just for the kids, but for us grown ups too.  I've used Mommy Bliss products before and they were very good.  These do taste a bit salty but salt is a very important electrolyte and for me, the most important one.  But it's in balance with other electrolytes so whoever is feeling ill should probably get some relief if they can keep these down.  I use electrolytes every time I play tennis since I sweat so much and I need the salt to recover quickly.",[],B07BRNK4JS,B07BRNK4JS,AEYVPPWR4CIKWX4BGYKCBCDL2CZQ,2018-10-20 13:49:57.218,0,False,3011,"('POSITIVE', 0.9796867370605469)",POSITIVE,0.9796867370605469

I use baby oil mainly in the bath tub on those rare occasions that I have enough time, peace and quiet to take a long soak.

I had always used the traditional, white diaper rash creams on my kids when they were babies and it wasn't until I used it on myself after getting chafed from a long hike did I realize that those diaper rash creams stung. I hope my babies weren't stung by the name brand diaper creams that were used on them but I wish I had the Petite Planet Multipurpose to use on them instead.  It's clear and has a nice scent, and though I don't know for sure, I doubt it will sting much, if any when applied to irritated skin.

4,Very good wooden spatula for the price,"I like cooking with wooden utensils because they won't damage my cookware or conduct heat, so this olive wood spatula is exactly what I'm looking for. The wood grain is beautiful, and it's carved from one piece of olive wood and feels so well-made that I doubt it will ever splinter or break. It feels good in the hand, has just the right amount of heft without being heavy, and the handle is long enough to make this useful to use in all of my pans.<br /><br />The shape of this spatula makes it very useful. The sides of the head are wide enough to scrape my favorite pans down when cooking and also have a slight curve which helps to fold batters or stir sauce.  The tip of the spatula has a slight taper to its front edge which is useful when turning fried foods. The leading edge of this spatula seems thin enough to turn French toast or get under the lip of an omelet to roll it, but probably not thin enough to turn pancakes with.<br /><br />I'm giving this 4 stars rather than 5 because some of the finishing details could be better. The leading edge of the spatula felt rough enough to catch a sponge when cleaning, so I gave it some additional sanding. Also, the top of the handle is sharply squared off and rough rather than being rounded and smooth. That makes it uncomfortable to hold, so I sanded that down until it was more rounded and smooth and now the handle feels fine.<br /><br />I own other kitchen utensils made of olive wood and know that if you take care of this spatula it can last for many years to come.

5,Attractive wooden serving spoon,"This is a very attractive hand carved beech wood spoon in natural oil finish. The shape and size of this spoon reminds me of the soup spoons at Asian restaurants, and it could be used for that. It has a notch carved into the back of the handle that would allow it to hook onto the bowl's rim so it couldn't slide down into the soup.  I'd need a few more of these to make a set of soup spoons though so I wasn't the only one with the pretty wooden spoon.<br /><br />This spoon is also just perfect for stirring sauces or puddings in the 2 quart sauce pan. The shape of the spoons deep bowl would allow it to reach deeply into the pot to scoop sauce or pudding up, swirl it to the side, and fully stir it all up. I could see me making Hollandaise sauce using this spoon, and once I was finished making it, I could use the spoon to ladle it over the poached eggs.  It would also be perfect as a serving spoon, showcased on the table or buffet to serve sauces or dip with. This beautiful little 8&#34; spoon is hand carved, so I felt every aspect of the spoon and didn't feel a single rough place. I'm very pleased with the quality and the appearance of this spoon.

I tried both the Lavender and the Champagne scents and loved them. The instructions don't say how much to put, so I put 2 capfuls and this was enough to give gentle bubbles and a lovely scent.<br /><br />The lavender is strong but not medicinal and the champagne has a slightly fruitier almost lychee undertone.  Both are lovely and not overly sweet.  The bubbles are soft and plentiful and the scents are relaxing and make me feel like I am somewhere else.  The minerals in the bath also feel soothing.  Overall, it feels very pampering and helps to wash away a tough week.<br /><br />I love the way that these bottles look in the bathroom as well.

1,Very very Disappointing,"Was so excited to receive my Eyelash Curler in roségold and that the gribs fo not have holes like a scissor. Also size looked more comfortable than the larger curlers....BUT so very disappointed. Product came in cheap plastic box that was part bend. When I eagerly unpacked my product I quickly realized that the high looking quality picture does not equal reality. The material looks poor/has spots like dents on supposed high polished roségold look. BUT far more important is that the actual curling area is completely crooked, lopsided. As a customer I don’t want to have to “fix” my product to be able to use it on my eyes and be satisfied with dented plastic looking like material. So very disappointed! In addition, this curler was $ 8,- +/- and not the cheaper curler that one can buy in a local Supercenter in person for $ 2.76 and is of much higher quality and can actually be used properly. Again very disappointing, frustrating, and waste of time and money.

5,Really does provide the support I was looking for,"I was skeptical because I don't like to buy things made of synthetic materials, but I got a Purple Royal and I'm trying it out.  Here's what I like about it so far:  I sit on a futon sofa much of the day with my laptop, and the sofa is depressed where I've been sitting, so I'm sinking into the futon.  The Purple Royal is 2 inches thick and lifts me up, and out of the sinkhole, distributing weight well across the futon mattress.  It feels cool to the backside, and allows plenty of spread instead of being flattened and squinched.  I'm using it with the black cover, but I'm going to put a pillowcase over it to match the cover on the futon mattress.  Another thing I like is that I can tuck it right at the back of the sofa and it does not come all the way out to the front of the sofa; there's about 4-5"" space between it and the edge of the sofa, which allows room for my legs to rest on the edge of the sofa instead of raising them up and cutting off blood flow.  I thought about getting the 2.25"" one (""double"") but that one has a ""soft side"" and I can't see any need for anything softer.  This one feels plenty soft and roomy.

4,Works well!,"I purchased this in pink, and the dusty rose color is misleading.  It is a hot pink.<br /><br />However, that’s my only real complaint.  I have adhesive sensitivities and haveyet to encounter a k tape I can wear for more than 24 hours.  So there is that limitation, but not an unexpected one.  I use this on things like wrist strains and also to secure magnets to painful areas for magnet therapy.  The peel off grid on the back of the tape makes it easier to estimate the amount needed for a task, especially if you have taped the same area before.<br /><br />For the newly initiated, a general rule of thumb in taping a small area to secure it is to have one length of tape stretched 75% and the matching strap cut longer and unstretched (like for a wrist).  Medium size areas like knees may require one unstretched and two stretched 50%—that sort of thing.  Never stretch both pairs 100%.  That may feel super supportive until it makes your skin peel (a lesson learned from my previous roll of k tape).  Try to go to a PT or chiro for instructions :).",[],B01LZM99OU,B01LZM99OU,AG5X4SJDII7ANYZ3IFPU23PMF2XQ,2018-04-08 17:52:47.381,0,False,3260,"('NEGATIVE', 0.997047483921051)",NEGATIVE,0.997047483921051

5,"Massive size.  Very little angle to the head, as I wanted.  Happy.","This is a huge spatula.  I like that it is almost straight (indeed I was hoping it would be completely straight up and down) unlike a turner.  (Note the picture where I compare this wood spatula to my pink silicone and SS turner that is much more angular.)  I wanted to have something with a firm base but a straighter design because a friend showed me that her straight up and down wooden spatula puts a lot less stress on the wrists when breaking up big batches of ground beef and shifting them around.  I tried to purchase a silicone head straight up and down spatula from Le Creuset, but for my intended use it was a waste of money--not firm enough and with too narrow of a head.  I am really looking forward to using this instead.  I do wish that instructions for the proper care of the wood (apart from not putting in the dishwasher) were included, as I am unused to wooden implements.  Also, there are a couple of slight indentations in the wood on the very bottom edge of the spatula; this may be customary in natural wood products, but I simply don't know If it is.  But other than that, I am pleased.<br /><br />Potential customers may be interested to note that this is large, definitely larger than most turners/spatulas I have previously encountered, that the bottom is almost but not quite flat/straight across, and that the corners of the bottom curve in ever so slightly in addition to the slight angle of the mostly-straight-on head.

3,"Tasty, but not keto-friendly","The taste is good. The ingredients are healthy and keto-friendly, other than Sucralose. I have consumed Bulletproof coffee regularly for years, so I am used to this type of coffee. One issue is the price, which is currently $3.50 per cup. If you have four cups per day, that is $14 per day and this pack will only last five days. You can make coffee at home, add your own butter, MCT oil and, collagen at a cost of $0.40 - $1 per cup. Where this product makes sense is when you are away from home, such as in the office or while traveling. For that use case, this product is good. Spending $3.50 on a cup of coffee is too much though.<br /><br />The other issue is that this product is not keto-friendly since it has Sucralose, which will spike insulin. The amount of Sucralose in this is not disclosed.",[],B0923983N6,B0923983N6,AH4Z47YBJ7FV42RHZBLKLGHH35CA,2021-10-13 19:20:03.350,1,False,3325,"('POSITIVE', 0.7153854370117188)",POSITIVE,0.7153854370117188
3,Unknown quality,"The front of the bottle says it has oil from wild Pollock and the back says it contains Tilapia, which is generally an unhealthy farm-raised fish that should be avoided. If the tilapia is only used to make the gelatin, the label should mention that. Oil from fish at the low end of the food chain would be better since those fish are less contaminated. Anchovies and sardines would be better. This fish oil does not have independent quality verifications listed, which is important for fish oil. This lacks IFOS certification or certification from LabDoor. If this is a natural triglyceride form of the oil, that means it is more likely to have contaminants. If this is synthetic triglyceride form, they should mention that. Other products that use AlaskOmega oil are IFOS certified, so there is a chance that this oil would pass those same tests, but the company should advertise that more.<br /><br />They added lemon flavor to the oil inside the capsules, which is unusual. It might be done to mask the taste of low-quality fish oil from people that open the capsules to evaluate freshness.<br /><br />The bottle is nice. The current price is $64 for 90 servings, or $0.71/serving. Doctor’s Best is selling very similar AlaskOmega Ethyl Ester oil for $0.43/serving. SmarterVitamins is also selling a nearly identical AlaskOmega product for less money.",[],B099KLQB9X,B099KLQB9X,AH4Z47YBJ7FV42RHZBLKLGHH35CA,2021-10-07 01:45:55.117,4,False,3326,"('NEGATIVE', 0.940252959728241)",NEGATIVE,0.940252959728241
4,A good morning supplement,"This is a basic supplement that works well. The L-Theanine helps reduce the anxiety that caffeine can cause. The 200 mg L-Theanine / 100 mg caffeine ratio is better than 100 mg / 100 mg. Some people like much more L-Theanine, so the powered bulk supplement might be better.<br /><br />The current cost is $11 for 60 servings, which is $0.18 per serving. It is inexpensive, but these are inexpensive ingredients and this combination is being sold by many vendors. This is certainly cheaper than a cup of coffee. You can add L-Theanine to your coffee as an alternative.",[],B09D2Y17D6,B09D2Y17D6,AH4Z47YBJ7FV42RHZBLKLGHH35CA,2021-09-20 01:06:20.819,0,False,3327,"('POSITIVE', 0.9976014494895935)",POSITIVE,0.9976014494895935
4,These help,"This product has ingredients that support natural testosterone production and increase libido. The effects are noticeable, although I doubt my actual testosterone levels are increased significantly. The noticeable effects are more likely due to increased dopamine.<br /><br />Some of these ingredients you need to be careful of, specifically the L-Dopa and DHEA. Too much of these supplements can cause anxiety and aggression. To my knowledge Tribulus does nothing and it is the dominant ingredient. The pills have a funky smell, which is from the indole-3-carbinol. I3C coverts to DIM in your body, and DIM is in these as well, which is redundant.<br /><br />Another supplement that seems to work is D-Aspartic Acid, but this is a bulk powder not a pill.<br />None of these easily-available supplements will have a huge impact on your testosterone levels compared to more powerful compounds that are harder to buy, but they should help slightly.<br /><br />The current price is $50, which is $0.83 per serving.

1,Underdosed and ineffective,"This product has no obvious effect on my brain. I took double the dose, and still nothing. Most of the ingredients are not associated with cognitive health, so I was not expecting this product to work, but I thought I would try it anyway. Bacopa is the only ingredient in this that is primary associated with brain benefits, and it is the reason this product is named Memory+. This has bacopa leaves, not the more potent extract. Supplements that contain standardized extracts are more effective. Plant-based products can have wide variability in their active compounds. Skip this product and get a standardized bacopa extract.<br /><br />I measured 780 mg of powder in two pills. This is far off the claimed 1000 mg of ingredients. I measured two more pills and got the same discrepancy. This company is under dosing its pills. Another product I tried from this company had the same problem.<br /><br />The company is hiding the quantities of the ingredients inside of a proprietary blend.",[],B08XN2GJ9Z,B08XN2GJ9Z,AH4Z47YBJ7FV42RHZBLKLGHH35CA,2021-04-14 08:29:38.593,0,False,3329,"('NEGATIVE', 0.999240517616272)",NEGATIVE,0.999240517616272
2,Too expensive compared to other brands,"People take curcumin for the anti-inflammation benefit. I don’t personally notice anything from taking a lot of curcumin from many companies. Considering the relatively high price for curcumin, I would like there to be a more noticeable benefit.<br /><br />I measure two pills having 1330 mg of powder in them, which is close to what I expect from the claimed 1310mg of ingredients. It means these capsules have minimal to no fillers, which is what they advertise.<br /><br />You are after the curcumin, not the turmeric, so the 100mg of turmeric extract is the important number when price comparing. The current price is $13 for 90 pills, which $1.44/gram. The 90-pill bottle is $0.94/gram. The NOW brand 60 pill bottle costs $0.33/gram. The Doctor’s best 120 pill bottle is $0.34/gram. Nothing about this B’LEAF NATURE curcumin would suggest that it is a better product that is worth such a price premium over the established reputable brands.<br /><br />You can buy tumeric root at the grocery store if that is what you want. Tumeric is too bulky relative to the active compounds for it to be a good supplement. Instead, focus on supplements that contain just the curcumin extract, and ones that contain more of the desired extract than what is in this pill.<br /><br />Made in the USA in GMP certified facility.",[],B08QFZGH1S,B08QFZGH1S,AH4Z47YBJ7FV42RHZBLKLGHH35CA,2021-04-03 15:38:45.550,2,False,3330,"('NEGATIVE', 0.996340274810791)",NEGATIVE,0.996340274810791
2,Not keto-friendly,"The chocolate shake tastes like brownie batter if you use coconut oil for the oil in the batter. It has a definite coconut taste. It has a lumpy texture, like brownie batter. If you use an immersion blender you can probably change the consistency, but even with a Blender Bottle shaker cup it is still lumpy.<br /><br />Room temp water with a spoon – does not mix<br />Cold milk with a spoon – does not mix well. A floating mass stays on top.<br />Hot coffee with a spoon – mixes better, but not great. Sludge settles to the bottom of the cup.<br />Cold milk in a Blender Bottle shaker – mixes better, but still not completely. Good enough though for me to skip the immersion blender.<br /><br />The product is clearly targeting people that want a lactose free shake. Shakes with milk taste better.<br /><br />The price is $30 as I write this, which seems too high for what it is.<br /><br />This product says “keto friendly,” but that is untrue. This is mostly carbs and protein. One of the main ingredients is maltodextrin. This drink will likely kick you out of ketosis and spike your insulin. While the carbohydrate count is under the threshold for ketosis, I would not drink this if you hope to be on a keto diet. To advertise “no sugar added,” then add in maltodextrin as the substitute is misleading, since it has the same negative effects as sugar.<br /><br />While I am not in the lactose-free target audience, I am in the keto diet target audience. For the target audience that I am in, this is a bad meal replacement.",[],B08MY6T43K,B08MY6T43K,AH4Z47YBJ7FV42RHZBLKLGHH35CA,2021-04-03 14:37:26.907,0,False,3331,"('NEGATIVE', 0.9991711378097534)",NEGATIVE,0.9991711378097534
3,You are paying for the fancy bottle,"This MCT oil comes in a fancy wine bottle and it is packaged like a fancy wine bottle. It has a slight taste of coconut oil, versus other MCT oils that have no detectable taste.<br /><br />You are paying a premium for the presentation of this oil, not for the quality of the oil. The bottle looks fancy and like a premium product, if that is the look you are going for. Maybe you are buying this for a bar or restaurant where the appearance matters. For the oil to be the highest quality, it would be better if this was 100% C8 oil. Other brands try to stand out by selling organic MCT oil.<br /><br />I drink MCT oil daily in coffee, and I have tried many of the brands. Another brand I have in my kitchen is the inexpensive Horbaach MCT oil that costs $0.15 / fl oz. This Genesis MCT oil has the same ratio of oils and costs $1.48 / fl oz. Premium 100% C8 MCT oil is cheaper than Genesis MCT oil.<br /><br />Many MCT oil bottles suffer from a pouring problem and drips. This bottle pours like a wine bottle, which is fine, and it has the problem with the last oil drip running down the side, like many other bottles. I keep my bottles on a paper towel.<br /><br />This MCT oil is sold in clear glass, versus nearly every other MCT bottle being sold. I am unaware of any issue with MCT oil degrading if exposed to light, but it is something to take note of. Many places caution to keep oils out of sunlight. The NOW brand sells their MCT oil in dark brown glass.<br /><br />The bottle says High Octane on it, which is silly marketing. They are likely trying to play off the pioneer in the field of MCT oils, Bulletproof Brain Octane C8 MCT Oil, which is higher quality and less expensive than this oil. Octane, the hydrocarbon, has a C8 molecule in it, which corresponds to the 100% C8 oil in the clever marketing of that competing product.",[],B08WRH6KTF,B08WRH6KTF,AH4Z47YBJ7FV42RHZBLKLGHH35CA,2021-03-30 17:04:11.332,2,False,3332,"('NEGATIVE', 0.9871337413787842)",NEGATIVE,0.9871337413787842
5,Great ingredients,"A good product with proven calming ingredients. These ingredients overlap with some sleeping pills, and this product can make you feel tired. For many people, these pills are best for after the work day is over and closer to bed time.<br /><br />If you are hoping for a flow state at work or an alternative to ADHD drugs, this product is not intended for that. If that is your goal, start with 200-400mg of L-theanine by itself to see how far that gets you. L-Theanine is an inexpensive pleasant tasting powder and it will be calming without making you tired.<br /><br />The price, as I write this, is $1/serving. That price is reasonable if you consider the premium ingredients, like KSM-66 Ashwagandha. You are paying for convenience by having a company blend powders and put them in a capsule. People in the target market can afford $1/serving.<br /><br />The product is made in the USA at a GMP facility.",[],B08L9HBW63,B08L9HBW63,AH4Z47YBJ7FV42RHZBLKLGHH35CA,2021-03-23 20:57:21.748,1,False,3333,"('POSITIVE', 0.9469905495643616)",POSITIVE,0.9469905495643616

I used to take it for my heart and memory but I'm not sure the science supports that.  I take one pill a day to supplement the large quantities of fish oil I get from fresh caught fish that we eat every other day.<br /><br />I chose this brand because of Consumer Labs' recommendations based on formulation, concentration, quality and price.

4,"Nice product, asks baker to adjust time-tested recipes a little","There is a whole lot going for this product. Cricket powder adds protein and essential aminos to your baking, which can easily up your food's nutrition profile.<br /><br />The downside, if you can even call it that, is the slight change it'll make to your food's taste. It is not at all overwhelming, but you'll notice a faint taste of something different - and that's it, not something bad or buggy but just different - and you or your guests/consumers may be initially put off.<br /><br />However, I expect this can be compensated for by including flavors with stronger profiles. I am trying to make a bread that is not overly sweet or the like, but I suspect the reason why most users of cricket powder vend sweet products is to offset the taste. When you use this product you may need to make some test batches first to see how the powder affects your food's flavors.<br /><br />In my first few batches, I made a banana bread with 2 tbsp of cricket powder that worked out 99%. I also made a more general sweet bread (a muffin recipe, but in a bread pan) using 2 tbsp of the powder, where the taste was more noticeable so perhaps 90% of where I wanted it to be.<br /><br />It's pricey, but the product is worth playing with and especially for if/when the premium declines and you know how to use it.",[],B010VU7GPA,B08WCNB5J8,AGFYBYSRFVWBV3F7JRSTI5VH2GDQ,2016-04-16 13:50:20.000,4,True,3408,"('POSITIVE', 0.5117865800857544)",POSITIVE,0.5117865800857544

5,This tape works good for our needs,"I got this Dr.Pedi Kinesiology Tape Bulk Muscle Tape for my wife and I - we have both been sidelined for several months. She severely broke her foot back in November 2020 and I hang a torn hamstring and then last month, surgery for another issue. I knew we’d be needing tape as we were allowed to get back into working out. Primarily I had wanted something for her - this foot break was so bad she was literally off it for 5 months - NO weight. And she loves working out, so I thought having tape would help give her support - and confidence - as she returns. She was finally cleared and has been very slow in building back up what she’s allowed to do. Today she finally was able to jump rope and put enough pressure on it to require the support. She’s very happy with the Dr.Pedi Kinesiology Tape Bulk Muscle Tape. First, there are three roles. Second, it comes in pre-cut lengths which were perfect for her. Today she had the whole piece - she used three full stripes at points around her foot. It proved excellent support and made her feel completely safe as she jumped - this is a major step forward for her after such a major break - 2 bones, one almost shattered. So that this Dr.Pedi Kinesiology Tape Bulk Muscle Tape kept her safe and secure is a good thing. Admittedly, she literally is only just back - and I’m still another week from being cleared - but I am so happy she felt safe while she was out there. She did not cut it down - there are the lines so she could have - but the recommendation was keep full pieces for what she needs. The corners are pre-rounded so we are hoping it keeps the corners from peeling too quickly. Again, this was her first time, but so far we are very happy with the outcome.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61HxZwLh+wL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61HxZwLh+wL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61HxZwLh+wL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61TSHbl4pGL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61TSHbl4pGL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61TSHbl4pGL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61nzcyzwFJL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61nzcyzwFJL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61nzcyzwFJL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08MZH8JLP,B08MZH8JLP,AHSL6SPJ3F6JQU4TG2UFMHVVQCKA,2021-07-15 23:11:24.510,0,False,3445,"('POSITIVE', 0.9954875111579895)",POSITIVE,0.9954875111579895
5,"Who knew these things could be so cool, feel so good, and help so well","My wife and I have gotten these types of heel protectors any number of times over the years, but when I saw these I thought I wanted to try - they were thicker and suede - to go in a certain group of shoes. They are slightly bigger than any other heel inserts I’ve ever had. I like this size and the feel and they look like they cover a better area overall within the shoes. Putting the shoes on you do - as with all of them - have to be careful not to pull it off. I suggest a shoe horn. The feel is really nice. It feels thicker and like it gives just that much better padding. You do - again, as always - have to be careful to stick them right from the start or they’re useless - these kinds of things always loose grip if you try to reset. So I peal the back off, fold them in half onto the cushion side, then lightly stick the fold into the part of the heal where I want the center to land. I stick that harder when I’m happy with the placement, then press in one side then the other. So far I’ve been far closer than not with each one. Overall I am very happy with these inserts and will be getting more - not just for my suede shoes, but for all of mine that need grips. We have the regular kind, but these are far better.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41ps+v19S1L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41ps+v19S1L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41ps+v19S1L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/510GGtJ0xTL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/510GGtJ0xTL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/510GGtJ0xTL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/5141rzG0TTL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/5141rzG0TTL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/5141rzG0TTL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61DenmQ4u9L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61DenmQ4u9L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61DenmQ4u9L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61LP4L53b5L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61LP4L53b5L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61LP4L53b5L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61kuRFnRryL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61kuRFnRryL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61kuRFnRryL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61qG0OtV7VL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61qG0OtV7VL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61qG0OtV7VL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08L6THG9Q,B08L6THG9Q,AHSL6SPJ3F6JQU4TG2UFMHVVQCKA,2021-01-27 00:14:40.539,1,False,3446,"('POSITIVE', 0.9899937510490417)",POSITIVE,0.9899937510490417

4,Some like it hot!,"There are red lights around the entire inside of the collar and an infrared heat coil over the spine in the back segment of the collar. It's easy to open and slide around your neck (which I tend to do from the front or side, then rotate the collar into place) and then short-press the power button on the front outside of the collar to start it. You can long-press to stop it at any time or short-press to cycle through 3 heats levels. The red lights appear to have only one intensity (yes! I wouldn't want them to dim). Even the lowest heat (#1) is pretty toasty, and I'm a gal who normally runs infrared as hot as it goes. After about a minute, it's too hot to press directly against my neck, but the collar design allows me to shift it slightly back and it'll stay that way. Overall, I'm pleased.

3,Doesn't smell quite like Boswellia Serrata,"This is the Boswellia Serrata variety of Frankincense. I regularly use the Boswellia carteri variety but have had a quality Boswellia serrata many years ago. This doesn't smell like I remember it, though it does smell pleasant. I also have a small bottle of Boswellia serrata from another brand that does smell like I remember. I don't know; this just smells sweet and like a perfume. I'm willing to accept that there might be some frankincense essential oil in this, but I feel doubtful about the claim that's all that in it (especially at $16 for nearly 4 fl. oz., now that I noticed the low pricing). I guess I'll use it as an air fragrance or like they suggest in soaps or bath bombs.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51VwXg7ACtL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51VwXg7ACtL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51VwXg7ACtL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61kK7u3oTHL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61kK7u3oTHL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61kK7u3oTHL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61rN-de-F3L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61rN-de-F3L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61rN-de-F3L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61w2AFL2-4L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61w2AFL2-4L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61w2AFL2-4L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7156sDtDWqL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7156sDtDWqL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7156sDtDWqL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71eJD2mumcL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71eJD2mumcL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71eJD2mumcL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71g++vsTEyL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71g++vsTEyL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71g++vsTEyL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09S8J95KP,B09SP5WN6P,AGRCXV4NM763VGZGD6BQ2VGNCJNA,2022-04-20 17:54:40.917,0,False,3452,"('POSITIVE', 0.9571637511253357)",POSITIVE,0.9571637511253357

4,"Small but powerful LEDS. Don't like the strobe, though.","The device comes with one battery. You unscrew the bottom of the device, put the battery in, and screw it back together. Then you unscrew the top and use the included USB charging cord to charge the battery whenever it's low. A red light next to the USB port indicates charging and green is charged. You screw on the top to use. The button is at one end and the lights at the other. The three LED therapy lights are very small, but they seem quite powerful. They shine brightly through my hand joints. My initial impressions are that this does help with my arthritis inflammation. The light should be used against bare skin and can be held directly against the skin. One of the lights is infrared (heat), so the head can get warm and you may need to let it cool (while off) before continuing to use it. It has 10 minutes before automatic turn-off, and the head only gets mildly warm by the end of that time . The therapy area (lighted area at the end) is 0.75"" across, so the downsize is the limited area that you can treat at one time while the advantage is that it's battery-powered portable. The power button sequence is: one press = on, two = off, three = strobe light, four = off. I don't like how fast the strobe light pulses and so will never use it. You never have to see the strobe if you just hit once to turn on and once to turn off (and wait before turning it back on).<br /><br />When placed on a hard surface, the little stand will hold the light pointed where you want it. I see no point to using the stand as distance decreases the penetrating power of the light hitting your skin.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51g9qMvB6gL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51g9qMvB6gL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51g9qMvB6gL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51hSZFdVowL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51hSZFdVowL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51hSZFdVowL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/6147T85XjfL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/6147T85XjfL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/6147T85XjfL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61KL4cvkj+L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61KL4cvkj+L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61KL4cvkj+L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61LByPu6EwL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61LByPu6EwL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61LByPu6EwL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61N8wBR3TFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61N8wBR3TFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61N8wBR3TFL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61QfAo0ESzL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61QfAo0ESzL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61QfAo0ESzL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ccdg5USXL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ccdg5USXL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ccdg5USXL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61dw8qn9V+L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61dw8qn9V+L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61dw8qn9V+L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61pWvixDClL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61pWvixDClL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61pWvixDClL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61pr6vLOzZL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61pr6vLOzZL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61pr6vLOzZL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61q4DTbohAL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61q4DTbohAL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61q4DTbohAL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61qun9U+XrL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61qun9U+XrL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61qun9U+XrL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61rltpPb1OL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61rltpPb1OL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61rltpPb1OL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61tlHkrRjKL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61tlHkrRjKL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61tlHkrRjKL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71GddjikBRL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71GddjikBRL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71GddjikBRL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71fhl-M78cL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71fhl-M78cL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71fhl-M78cL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09L66QHHN,B0BJQ4XVCR,AGRCXV4NM763VGZGD6BQ2VGNCJNA,2022-01-15 21:18:11.087,30,False,3454,"('POSITIVE', 0.870307445526123)",POSITIVE,0.870307445526123
3,"The area that gets warm is 15"" x 10.5""","This heating pad only puts out heat along the center columns of rock: about 1"" wide x 10.5"" long column of rock with a 0.75"" space between the columns of rock.

However, I had the pad on my lap, a pillow on top, and my Kindle on top of that (several inches above the back of the pad). I noticed that the battery power on the Kindle dropped 10% in just a few minutes (which is really, really fast) and I had to reboot the Kindle to fix the battery drain.

You squirt a little liquid soap on these and rub it on a wet face, and the soap suds up nicely and cleans well. The only problem is that soap can get on the other side and make the pad slippery to hold. I just grasp the knob between two fingers (rather than sticking my fingers in the pocket), and then I can keep a pretty good grip.<br /><br />There is also a scrubber that has a sponge inside. You can squirt soap on the sunny face, then squeeze the sponge to create a fine, white foam from the soap. These bristles are a little bit firmer than the pads, but they are still very nice feeling on the face. The reverse side has thicker, stiffer silicone bristles. The sponge is pretty easy to squeeze and pull out of the hole. It dries quickly when removed. The scrubber is a nice size to easily hold and squeeze while using. It is 2 inches tall by 2 inches wide.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/612Uz+uoj0L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/612Uz+uoj0L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/612Uz+uoj0L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61AI29C4nML._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61AI29C4nML._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61AI29C4nML.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61FD+M5swFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61FD+M5swFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61FD+M5swFL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61RdH80oPfL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61RdH80oPfL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61RdH80oPfL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61W0ubjyWJL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61W0ubjyWJL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61W0ubjyWJL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61YbUU7cisL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61YbUU7cisL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61YbUU7cisL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61baypW8u9L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61baypW8u9L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61baypW8u9L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Bb1aPX1QL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Bb1aPX1QL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Bb1aPX1QL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71GS36ZDJiL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71GS36ZDJiL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71GS36ZDJiL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71MKuQ-BLaL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71MKuQ-BLaL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71MKuQ-BLaL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71eFqM56eDL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71eFqM56eDL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71eFqM56eDL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B089B723MS,B089B723MS,AGRCXV4NM763VGZGD6BQ2VGNCJNA,2020-07-01 16:29:33.229,1,False,3458,"('POSITIVE', 0.9928951859474182)",POSITIVE,0.9928951859474182
3,"Easy to grasp and use, but the sponge is so dense that it doesn't dry quickly","While I really like this design in some ways, the sponge is somewhat difficult to remove and replace because it is dense and likewise never seems to dry out because it is so dense. The sponge appears to be made from cellulose. The idea is that you squirt liquid soap onto the side with holes that lead down to the sponge. This creates a reservoir of soap that can be released when you squeeze the sponge. The soft silicone bristles feel nice on the skin. There is a slit in the bottom of the silicone casing where you can pull the sponge out. I initially tried hanging this bath brush in an airy spot with the sponge inside, but the sponge hadn't dried at all after 24 hours. I pulled the sponge out and put it in an airy spot, but it still took two days to dry out. So, if you use this every day, it's never going to dry out and will probably start to mold.<br /><br />I like the size as it is easy for me to hold while using. The side that doesn't have holes has projections that are a little stiffer and rougher, presumably get rid of dead skin or stubborn dirt. There is a loop for hanging or to put over your wrist when using it. The scrubber can be used without the sponge by squirting the soap on the bristles, but the scrubber doesn't hold its shape well without the interior sponge and so is more difficult to hold. I'm thinking of trying to find a softer, easier to squeeze sponge that might fit in this. The main body of the scrubber is 5"" long by 3"" wide by 1.75"" deep. Made in China.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/616bi7-kRdL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/616bi7-kRdL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/616bi7-kRdL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61FFrNMakDL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61FFrNMakDL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61FFrNMakDL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71G5njvMEiL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71G5njvMEiL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71G5njvMEiL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71HrJo-nt8L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71HrJo-nt8L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71HrJo-nt8L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Mi3kQuMbL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Mi3kQuMbL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Mi3kQuMbL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71V49+J48tL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71V49+J48tL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71V49+J48tL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Wv3Ed9cSL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Wv3Ed9cSL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Wv3Ed9cSL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71YKls1nsSL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71YKls1nsSL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71YKls1nsSL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71iDblKOWzL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71iDblKOWzL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71iDblKOWzL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B088STQXVN,B088STQXVN,AGRCXV4NM763VGZGD6BQ2VGNCJNA,2020-07-01 16:19:25.889,3,False,3459,"('NEGATIVE', 0.983346700668335)",NEGATIVE,0.983346700668335

3,Soft. Rests against eyes.,"This package came with two silk sleep masks and a pair of foam ear plugs. One sleep mask is black on both sides and the other has purple on one side and black on the other.  The fabric is smooth and soft against the skin. The elastic band that holds the mask on is doubled over and is adjusted by sliding the fastener (rather than with a bulky snap or velco closure). I find this closure/adjustment method more comfortable than my current sleep mask. The mask is thick enough to block light, and the mask does narrow (as in, has a ""cut out"") in the nose area for a somewhat better fit. But there is no molding or pillowed area to hold the mask above your eyes or fill the gap created between the cheek and the nose, so light does get under the mask. The mask lies directly against my eyelashes, and I don't really care for that. The stitching is neat.<br /><br />The mask measures 8.5"" across by 4"" high (or 3.5"" high where it dips up at the nose area).

I have dry skin as I am older - I don't have ""dual"" skin with oily and dry patches.  I have dry skin, period.

This product is so wimpy - it has barely anything scrubby in the paste meaning I would need to use about half the tube just to get enough scrubbies on my face to get rid of the dead, dry skin on my face (especially on my forehead and around my nose).

I place a pad on the front, just above my armpit and then one pad on the back, usually around the outer edge of the shoulder blade.  I could attach two more pads, but usually two is enough.  I then choose a pattern, strength and time and let the TENS unit do the rest.  The electrical charge that passes around/through the muscle mass in that area does help to ease the stiffness and pain.

This foot steamer is still large like all foot massagers of any type are, but what was nice is the small amount of water used so that didn't add weight to the unit that I had to deal with afterwards - big plus!

The spray is refreshing and cooling and leaves no gross sticky residue.  I use it daily and have not had any issues. It also helps prevent sweaty chaffing when I'm out working hard in the hot sun.  Another winning product from Gold Bond.,[],B08W5FL1BT,B08W5FL1BT,AHX2B4DEER2QR3IU3CCNB3CWC6TA,2021-06-26 15:10:38.038,0,False,3494,"('POSITIVE', 0.7008240222930908)",POSITIVE,0.7008240222930908

I tried it out when I had a slight migraine and it didn't help but it also didn't make it worse.

Vegetable glycerin metabolizes differently than sugar and is used in low carbohydrate foods for sweetness and moisture. Unlike sugar, glycerin does not contribute to tooth decay.<br /><br />Many household products, including lotions, shampoo, and toothpaste, contain vegetable glycerin. Glycerin is added to these products because it is a humectant; a substance that attracts moisture to the skin. In the cosmetic world, this has two practical applications. First, glycerin leaves your skin hydrated. Glycerin soap, for example, is popular for that very reason. Second, for cosmetic products that deliver an active ingredient, a humectant can increase the solubility of the active ingredient, making it more easily absorbed by the skin.<br />I personally use this glycerin to make my own soap.

It is well made and works great.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/411kN1hQAPL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/411kN1hQAPL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/411kN1hQAPL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41MnJ+zunML._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41MnJ+zunML._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41MnJ+zunML._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41Vmoanp30L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41Vmoanp30L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41Vmoanp30L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41mmE3RRvrL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41mmE3RRvrL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41mmE3RRvrL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/510SBIBbevL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/510SBIBbevL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/510SBIBbevL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/515yMHe3UtL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/515yMHe3UtL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/515yMHe3UtL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51YFcOcq6kL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51YFcOcq6kL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51YFcOcq6kL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ij+WzLExL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ij+WzLExL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ij+WzLExL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51zwI4xMUrL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51zwI4xMUrL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51zwI4xMUrL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09FKT5PQ9,B09FKT5PQ9,AHISU6WTZZJNNVYK5A5UITDIWCNQ,2022-02-06 14:15:09.435,1,True,3617,"('POSITIVE', 0.999661922454834)",POSITIVE,0.999661922454834

Sometimes it is pretty bad and very painful. This foot file just took seconds to use, it does not hurt at all and my feet were alot smoother and softer  when I got done. I really like that this can be used wet or dry. It is very light weight and super easy to use. The buffer is made from a natural ceramic and the handle is a beech wood handle that is very smooth. It does have a hole on the handle and it has a piece of twine so you can hang it when not in use.

5,SO BEAUTIFUL FOR A REMEMBRANCE BRACELET,[[VIDEOID:acecbe1ae181eaa1062c3828d213bfa]] A very close personal friend of mine has recently lost a few of her furry kids that she has had for around 15 years. She has been really heart broken and it doesn't help that she has a few more kitties around the same age. She does cat rescue and even though she has several other kitties she takes it very hard when she loses 1 of her beloved pets.She doesn't have any children of her own so her animals are her babies. She also lost her beloved father a few years ago so she has had her share of sadness. So I have been thinking about making her a bracelet that would have  charms to do with cats and dogs and maybe something to do with her dad.

4,Great for Sensitive Backsides!,"I think we've used about every wipe there is to use between the 3 of my children(8 months to 5 years). With newborns, Pampers was my choice. I had to change diapers often, and they worked great at working against diaper rash. Admittedly, though, as my children got older, we gravitated toward Huggies wipes. Pampers seems to have different kinds of wipes. There was one kind that seemed so slimy, we couldn't bear to use it, and it seemed that no matter how hard we tried we ended up with that particular one. We keep wipes just about everywhere and use them on our hands, too(particularly during car rides). We prefer Huggies when it comes to hand use.<br /><br />These are great, though, when it comes to backsides! They ARE a little more on the slimy side than Huggies, but these are more durable. With Huggies wipes, they're constantly tearing or we end up pulling out 4 wipes stuck together.<br /><br />These seem to come apart(from each other)much better. You can tug and pull on these and see just how much more durable they are. We generally have better coupons from Pampers, so we usually end up with Pampers wipes. I'll be honest, though, and say that when we have the coupons, we get Huggies wipes. We like them both for different reasons! We ONLY use one of the two, though. From my experience and opinion, just forget generic brands when it comes to wipes.<br /><br />If your little one has a sensitive backside, though, I highly recommend these!

The cleaning tool is super robust with a metal center rod and two varying sizes silicone tips.

I've had it for a couple of months now and it sure beats having to stay still in front of a light for 30 minutes.  I just don't always have the time to do that.  This is great because it allows you to get your SAD light dosage while doing chores around the house or getting ready in the morning.  I wish there was a battery indicator, but you have to guess when to charge it.  The built in timer choices are 15, 30, and 45 minutes, so you don't have to look at the clock to see when you're done.  You can choose the light intensity from 1-5 which is really helpful.  Often first thing in the morning my eyes can't take anything brighter than the 2 setting, but after 5 minutes I can turn it to the 4 setting and be comfortable. You can also adjust the angle of the lighting. The visor is hard and sturdy, but it is super comfortable because it has a plushy band in the parts where it makes contact with your head.

It's nowhere near as sweet as honey, and it does taste very earthy, but this is delicious! If you like any healthy foods, then you'll love this.<br /><br />If you've never tried bee pollen before, or if it's been a while, then you're supposed to start out with just a few grains at a time, and then build yourself up to eating it by the spoonful. But, luckily I've build up a tolerance to it over the years, so I can eat a lot of it. It's great to just eat by the handful, except the granules are small, and a few of them fall to the floor. It's great in protein shakes. Even though they don't fully dissolve, then they naturally sweeten your drink. They're also great on ice cream, too. Basically, these mix well with everything, and they're also great by themselves.<br /><br />YS Eco is an Illinois company, so the closer that you live to Illinois, then the better that you get the &#34;local honey&#34; effect of helping with your allergies. But, I live all the way over in Utah, and this pollen still helps me out a lot with my allergies.<br /><br />I read some horror stories about other bee pollens, and so I've been meticulously checking this for bee parts.

It's going back.<br /><br />I also tried the coccyx cushion from Living Better Tools (http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00YGC7S1C). It's larger and quite thick. It is contoured to fit your legs and has a nice non-skid rubber backing to hold it in place. It costs a bit more.

5,"PERFECT 'Small' Bag, but the actual size is deceptive! It's a real Powerhouse!","This would be great to travel with too, but I wanted a bag to keep the necessary medical items together even at home. I considered getting a generic bag, like a shaving kit zipper case, but I chose the medical logo so it'd be clear what type of things were inside. The straps are a great length to slip the bag on your forearm and transport it wherever. I needed a small zipper bag, that did not say First Aid kit, to carry my blood monitor, pulse oxometer, and a BP cuff. Bingo, I found it!!! I was a bit worried when I opened the bag because it first looked like it'd be too small, but man this little guy is deceiving. I fit all the necessaries in and it's not overstuffed at all. I've already got another one in my cart, in a different color, to carry prescriptions; these days, doctors are saying -- you must bring the actual bottles of prescriptions you take to each appointment; one of them even put up a sign in the waiting room that you will not be seen without your med bottles.  It's another discussion that he thinks old folk either forget things or get them confused, but this bag in blue will be a lot classier than a gallon zip plastic bag that most people use. I like the idea of keeping my drugs hidden--it's nobody's business (in a crowded waiting room) what drugs I take. I could go on but you get the idea; I love this bag. I included three photos to give you an idea of the size.

I have just such a trip planned in the next few months so I'll have to update this review after I've been able to use the pillow for a prolonged time.<br /><br />I do like the fact that the outer cover can be easily removed for washing. the snap is great because I can snap it onto my luggage handle and not worry about it falling off. If I had a choice, I probably would not have picked red, but now that I have it, the red is actually a good thing to have because it stands out. I certainly wouldn't lose this easily or forget it.<br /><br />If you're looking for a firm but comfortable neck pillow, this will do the trick!",[],B01LI0GHOI,B01M28UMRW,AF5JU3VCZM2XNQAN6T7NFJEENENA,2017-09-21 05:15:16.011,0,False,3842,"('POSITIVE', 0.9919735193252563)",POSITIVE,0.9919735193252563
4,I do really like using it however I had to knock a star ...,I bought Rezblock to use in my oil rigs.

I was smoking with moldy water for god knows how long until I discovered that. I was a little skeptical to keep using it but anytime I clean my rig and change the water using Rezblock it just dumps the oil out with the water.

Putting it on wasn't a problem for me either.<br /><br />It functions as advertised and arrived quickly. I definitely recommend to my family and friends. This support really helps relieve a lot of the everyday minor aches and pains associated with bad posture due to sitting at a desk, looking at a phone, and all the other habits that lead to bad posture.<br /><br />The price is right for the quality of the product as well, especially with the discount!

5,Much better than the old thing with tennis balls my grannie had (;,"I ordered this because I have a hip replacement coming up and, after checking out the walkers Medicare would provide for me, decided this is a much better option. While I've only tried it out so far, I am pleased with its appearance and solidity. It is very sturdy and, with the back wheels being further apart than are the front wheels, there is more room for me. Another feature that I really like is that I can pull up on the strap in the middle of the seat and fit it through a narrow bathroom door, while still using it for support. While this is a heavy nylon seat--and not padded--it and the back fit me well and provide solid lumbar support. Someone else looked at it today and was quite impressed. She said they paid over $500 for a walker for her brother that was flimsy, with metal that quickly bent, so that the thing was useless. She plans to get one of these for her mother. The only downside seems to be that the included cupholder can't be put on without loosening a strange-looking screw--we have to find a screwdriver that will fit it. A cane holder is also included. The velcro-attached bag is good sized. If you want to go to the hassle of removing 8 screw--gizmos with large plastic heads (they are easy to do) and lower the arms, it will fit in the included bag.",[],B018WO3E7G,B018WO3E7G,AGNHBTHMXSDSFBMBYAT46MWFEEHA,2017-10-20 00:11:20.244,2,True,3997,"('POSITIVE', 0.9849821329116821)",POSITIVE,0.9849821329116821
5,"Amazing, effective, high tech and REALLY PINK. I love it! What a massage!","Oh gosh, oh gee, oh my.....my sister was just saying they got her husband a foot massager at one of the membership club stores and that they felt it was a waste of money. This one isn't! Even though I got it at a discount in exchange for a fair, unbiased, honest review, I am amazed by this!  I have never had a foot massage like this.  It has a bunch of functions. Air pressure makes the massage harder or milder (start out low) and there is also a function that gives you the option of high and low levels of heat.  There is also a kneading massage and a shiatsu massage as well as an air pressure massage. And yes, there is a major difference with the shiatsu massage hitting all sorts of areas between and around the areas that the kneading massage hits. There is a timer and an auto function that cycles through other functions, but that does not seem to include the shiatsu massage. This is really, really pink.  It is also very high tech with glowing lights at the front. The first thing I actually noted was how heavy it is. The handle in the top of the box is really helpful! The drawing says the covers in the foot areas are detachable, but I didn't see how to detach them, so suggestions would be welcome...I don't want to wreck my new toy!  Or maybe it will be in another review?  I've had it turned off for 10 minutes now and can still feel a difference in my feet and lower legs.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/615z4wuociL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/615z4wuociL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/615z4wuociL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61EbD8ja0RL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61EbD8ja0RL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61EbD8ja0RL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61IPv0Xk4pL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61IPv0Xk4pL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61IPv0Xk4pL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61IvZI3y0PL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61IvZI3y0PL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61IvZI3y0PL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61b3WESCQ7L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61b3WESCQ7L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61b3WESCQ7L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61d-h0DyYNL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61d-h0DyYNL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61d-h0DyYNL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61xxg7+P2AL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61xxg7+P2AL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61xxg7+P2AL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71MBP68ZeBL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71MBP68ZeBL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71MBP68ZeBL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71cuImEpKDL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71cuImEpKDL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71cuImEpKDL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71fjo9D67AL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71fjo9D67AL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71fjo9D67AL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81DauXCNN0L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81DauXCNN0L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81DauXCNN0L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01GGNTX7A,B01GGNTX7A,AGNHBTHMXSDSFBMBYAT46MWFEEHA,2016-07-10 00:17:09.000,7,False,3998,"('NEGATIVE', 0.9871401190757751)",NEGATIVE,0.9871401190757751

I would have just glued or taped the box, but it should never come that way.  Shipping is hard on these kinds of things, but the box their in should not crush like and elephant sat on it.

But it does hold more pills! And it will be easier to fill, no lids in the way. And there is less chance of spilling. All the containers are secure in the white box. Also the slider lid is more secure than 4 little lids that can pop open. So all that said... Its a great BIG pill organizer and I’m keeping it!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/6142YbXFg8L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/6142YbXFg8L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/6142YbXFg8L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61QrN-eJvVL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61QrN-eJvVL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61QrN-eJvVL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61teU50irKL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61teU50irKL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61teU50irKL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ChuMc+QLL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ChuMc+QLL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ChuMc+QLL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71TNY-xfbaL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71TNY-xfbaL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71TNY-xfbaL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Z-w-kGhqL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Z-w-kGhqL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Z-w-kGhqL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B075QT2DTK,B075QT2DTK,AGTYV5LRMU6GFKGC6RPCCB5KDQ7Q,2019-06-13 20:58:11.287,7,True,4047,"('POSITIVE', 0.8018693923950195)",POSITIVE,0.8018693923950195

These don't fit an adult face unless you have a small chin. To get the mask to cover the nose, the bottom edge of the mask will press into your skin above your chin and below your bottom lip. It's not a super sharp plastic edge, but it's enough to make a mark when you wear it for a while.<br />  - 3. There's nothing to attach this to the mask, so when you remove the mask, this will fall off onto the floor or the ground unless you remember to catch it as it falls.<br />  - 4.

This is my second TENS unit and it is definitely better than the first one I had. I am very nearsighted and 70 years old and I can easily read the screen on this one. I don't have to get out my magnifying glass to read the screen,  which is very important when you're uncomfortable  and trying to get some relief.<br />It arrived packaged very well as you can see from the video I attached and even fits back into the box which is unusual! I will keep this unit and a few pads and the manual in the enclosed pouch and store it right by my recliner. That way I can keep the box in my closet and just have the tidy pouch sitting right by my chair where I need it. I usually use the pads for 30 minutes and find that my neck and shoulders are much improved. The pads stay sticky after many uses so this unit will be by my side for a long time! My sister tried it out  I was so impressed she pulled out her phone and ordered one right from the recliner! This saves me a lot of trips to the chiropractor and lot of co-pays.  It definitely pays for itself quickly. It was an excellent purchase.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qH+ccnRyL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qH+ccnRyL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qH+ccnRyL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B082SXGP38,B082SXGP38,AGXCMSSLLQHPXRXCJHDBKA7WXD2Q,2020-12-24 13:23:10.925,6,True,4109,"('POSITIVE', 0.9955132603645325)",POSITIVE,0.9955132603645325

The expensive phytoceremides comes in a translucent plastic bottle and 39.00 dollars per unit.  Herbal Nitrition, comes in a white plastic bottle and  For two bottles paid half the price .  Orders are processed and delivered quite quickly .  Excellent product!  As long as I use this product will be loyal to Herbal Nutrition LLC.

2,Wish they would improve it because it's a nice little table for the bed.,"I've had this table a couple of years. Cons: It has a permanent &#34;lean downward&#34; towards the center of the bed. Also, one of the legs kept sliding down (the button kept slipping instead of staying in the hole) causing that side of the table to cave, and everything would fall off. My husband drilled a hole and screwed that leg permanently at the level of the other leg. IF the manufacturer wanted to improve on the design, they could insert corner supports under the table top where it meets the legs. That could prevent the &#34;sag&#34; or lean downwards towards the center of the bed. The other way it could be permanently improved would be to create the table-to-leg at about a 50 to 55 degree setting instead of the 45 degree (which causes the sag). Even placing diagonal metal supports from the legs to the table would keep the table up and horizontal to the bed. Pros: It's very easy to slide out and replace when you need to change sheets. The table top also has a &#34;lip&#34; all the way around that helps keep items from sliding off the table. It's lightweight, easy to clean, doesn't rust (we live on an island) and you can place it closer to you or farther down the bed, wherever you want it without any trouble at all.

5,Glowing Review From Mrs. Thomas,"As a woman, I love the convenience of Lady-Comp (LC) and the fact that it has no negative side-effects. It's the only ""contraception"" (i.e., natural family-planning method) my husband & I have ever used, and we've been married over a year without pregnancy. [2013 update: we've been married over two years now and still no pregnancy, LC works great]<br /><br />This little computer is so effective at learning my cycle that a day before my period it flashes a blinking ""M"" to alert me that I will menstruate soon. It's very accurate. I have irregular cycles, yet LC is smart enough to take that into account and still pinpoint my ovulation day.<br /><br />Supposing you take your temperature with LC daily as instructed (which is then stored in its memory), my personal conviction is that, barring a miracle, it's impossible to conceive when LC gives a green light after your ovulation.<br /><br />With LC, a green light means ""Go ahead; you're not fertile,"" a red light means ""Wait! You're fertile!"" and a yellow light means ""You might be fertile. If you don't want to conceive right now, you should wait until it's green.""<br /><br />My husband & I purchased our LC from RaxMedical; their customer service is unparalleled. A staff member instructed me over the phone how to enter my data into LC and answered all my questions.<br /><br />I have never used any other method because for me it was never an option to put something in my body (such as the pill, IUDs, injections, etc.) that would negatively affect my reproductive health. With LC my health, hormones, and fertility are intact. It's a completely natural method, yet with a high-tech twist.<br /><br />LC is slightly larger than a DVD in circumference. It looks like a little flying saucer, especially when its light is blinking :o)<br />Mrs. Thomas",[],B004DEIH6S,B004DEIH6S,AGXHL2B6PER4TVFVWFV3ZQ6JY73A,2011-12-06 15:40:23.000,6,False,4188,"('POSITIVE', 0.9950226545333862)",POSITIVE,0.9950226545333862

5,Love it,"I should preface this by saying that I have never used a shampoo brush before, so I have nothing to compare this one to.<br /><br />That said I really like it.  I have short damaged (Bleached) hair.  While I was ill and couldn’t really leave the house for a few months my short pixie went from cute to shaggy and uneven.  Part pixie, part shaggy, nearing a pretty standard bob length.  Decided I should get a few things to help spoil it while trying to grow it for awhile.  First up was a oil.  While researching that I noticed some folks who swear by these for scalp massages / to help with shampooing.  I generally use a bar shampoo so I wasn’t sure this would  be great for me, but I love it.<br /><br />I saw some reviewers concerned that the bristles are too soft.  I suspect that’s a personal preference thing.  We had a similar pet brush that did have harder bristles.  Before using it on the cat, I tried it on me and did not like it.  I do, however like these bristles.  Now I’ll add that I have sensitive skin, so maybe with someone who can take a lot more abuse than I can, the harder bristles would be better, but for me, these are just right.<br /><br />Do they help promote hair growth?  Who knows.  I’m not going to be measuring my hair.  Do they give you a nice little massage as you work in your shampoo?  Yes.  Do they make it easier to work your shampoo into every little hair on your hair?

1,"Product should be labeled ""PLASTIC""","When I clicked on this listing I assumed automatically that these bottles were glass. They look like (and shine like) the many other dark amber glass bottles I have in my cabinet and are not listed anywhere otherwise. In fact, I understood the &#34;4 pound&#34; shipping weight as a confirmation that they were glass. This package was not even half a pound....<br /><br />I am unsure of what type of plastic this is as there is literally no labeling or info about product other than how to mix colloidal silver. I do not feel comfortable letting my daughter inhale out of the nasal sprayer in a plastic bottle. BPA or non BPA, plastic is not safe AT ALL, let alone storing silver in it. You'd think when dealing with those who use Colloidal silver, they are already researching. They are looking for real products that work and are mindful of chemicals. Plastic is a no brainer on my list of do not buys.<br /><br />I wish the seller would have provided a more in depth description that goes further then the, &#34; 2 sprayers and 1 dropper for all your ASAP Silver Sol needs.&#34; that was provided.<br /><br />These will just be thrown away.<br />The shipping was WAY too long, they charge a restocking fee for returned non damaged items and for 8 dollars total, I'm ok with just throwing them away.

5,Totally solved my problem . . .,"Because of the way I have my desk and computer set up, I lean on my left elbow while at my computer. IN addition, my husband does most of the driving and while in the car, I tend to lean my left arm on the arm rest. Soon, I had a problem. I essentially developed a &#34;bed sore&#34; on my left elbow, and no matter how many creams and tender loving care I gave it, I couldn't seem to get rid of it. Then I found and purchased this item (2 in fact -- one for desk area, one for car), and in no time, my elbow began to clear up. It took off the pressure, and gave the creams and ointments time to do their work. I like the idea that my arm doesn't overheat, because of the mesh that keeps most of the arm cool. Other styles didn't have that.  The pad slips around a little, but not badly, and easily moves back into place.  I keep the computer one on a small shelf that is part of my desk, and the one for the car, I keep in that built-in &#34;side-pocket&#34; in the door. I told my dermatologist about what I was doing, and he thought it was brilliant!  Hope it works as well for you!

At 178lbs the recommended dosage is 22 scoops for me. Because im sensitive to stimulants that is just too much. Everytime i do two scoops I end up bonking mid workout. Shaky hands, starving, have to stop and eat and rest a good half hour before finishing. I always eat an hour before my workout and only have this issue with two scoops. One scoop for me is perfect. Makes my face tingle, helps me kill my workout. I love this stuff. so my recommendation is to try it in different dosages until you find your sweet spot.

5,"even though heavier than buckwheat, I like it better","I originally gave this a 3 star review because I thought it was too heavy - and I ordered a buckwheat & rice wrap -- although this is heavier than the other one,  the reality is that compariatively they are very close.... I guess when shoulders are sore they are more sensitive - I find myself reaching for this one because of the cape-like design - it distributes the heat where I need it.  I'm giving it 5 stars although if there was a 4.5 option I'd probably pick that - I wish there was a way to have the contents shift around less, maybe some internal sections, if that would work with also needing to shift the beads around when nuking them to distribute the heat - not sure if the physics of that but if a couple strategically placed compartments were possible, that would improve this.  I think the fill to internal space ratio is very good so don't add more beads, I like to nap with this and don't like to nap with the buckwheat one because it is too thick and won't flatten out<br /><br />below is original for reference<br /><br />Very Very Heavy -- this is much heavier than I realized even though I read the other comments.  It's really too heavy for me.  I'm going to keep it as it is as advertised, at least I think so, I didn't think it held heat as long as they said but I only nuked it for the 1 minute.  I will use it sometimes but will need to be careful with it and only use it for short period of time because of the amount of compression the weight puts on my shoulder.  I'm using it because of an issue in an arm that is affecting shoulders and I want my lymph fluid to flow freely.

4,"Good beginner set, but not very durble.","This product was priced very well but isn't top quality. That being said, what you do get is a nice cheap way to incorporate cupping into your massage practice. You get quite a bit in size options so thats very helpful, and they do maintain good suction. The only thing i don't like is that over time the plastic cups show signs of being brittle and some have cracked. They did last me quite a while for being so cheap so i cant complain. I wasn't looking for a big investment so for the price it was worth it to me and i use it as my practice set. I did enjoy the cupping procedure and the pump handle really lets you control the strength of the suction quite well. So, if you'd like to try out cupping but don't want to invest in an expensive kit, this one is the one for you! The cupping technique has helped me with my shoulder pain as it really breaks up adhesions and gives more blood flow to the area. I place the cup on a sore spot and suction the skin about half way up the cup and let it stay for a few minutes like that. Another technique is to put massage oil on the area of your skin first, then suction it a little less than half way and then slide the cup around.

1,Leaves Black Streaks on Bathroom Floor- Nothing Works to Fix This Problem Permanently,"Latest Update (Jan. 2018): After 2-3 YEARS of trying to keep the little feet on the scale from leaving black streaks on the bathroom floor, I gave up and threw this scale away.  Cleaning the feet did not work; coating the feet with clear nail polish worked only for a time; attaching felt covers on the feet also only worked temporarily.  Amazing.  SO RELIEVED to be rid of the bloody thing.<br /><br />Update: I removed one star after using this scale for about a year now.  The scale rests on little square rubber feet, and these little bits of rubber leave black streaks on my tiled bathroom floor every single time I move the scale on the floor.  It's like the rubber feet are made of soot.  I tried cleaning them, but no amount of cleaning prevents the feet from leaving black streaks.  I finally painted over the feet with clear nail polish top coat.  That worked for a while but the top coat apparently wears off after a while.  I've had to repaint the rubber feet after a few months.  Awful!<br /><br />This is the best bathroom scale I have owned.  Ever!  It is sleek in design, easy to read with the bright blue-lit background.  Most importantly, it is accurate!  My old scale used to give a differenr reading each time I got on it, even if it was seconds apart.  Also, this scale uses regular  batteries instead of the hard-to-find LED batteries the old scale used.  I have only had this scale for about 2 weeks but I am really glad  I made the switch.

1,Major issues to be aware of,"I ordered this shaver for my husband to try, and we’ve had nothing but problems with it. It wasn’t charged at all upon receiving it, it was completely dead.  We put it on the charger for several hours as the manual recommended and it worked.<br /><br />While charging there is a red light next to where the cable plugs in, and the light stays lit all the time  even after the shaver is charged. So you never knew if the battery if fully charged and whether or not it will overheat.<br /><br />The shaver manual is not much help and in fact makes this product more confusing. The printed manual and writing on the shaver box have conflicting charging instructions. The manual says to charge up to 8 hours and advises no longer.  The box says 1 hour for 60 minutes of shaving. This is kind of confusing because my husband was never able to get 60 minutes of use after charging.  He was only able to get 2 shaves each at about 7 minutes before the battery went dead and had to be recharged.<br /><br />So…. my husband will not be using this shaver since the battery keeps going dead. And the rotary blades are weakening from pressing the shaver against his face.  This shaver is a no-go.",[],B09PFZQ8YB,B09PFZQ8YB,AHHQMVOQSY4WOIU5AWA5AEAQPJ6Q,2022-07-04 05:23:59.325,0,False,4337,"('NEGATIVE', 0.9991495609283447)",NEGATIVE,0.9991495609283447

3,7 Blades a Whacking,"The appearance of this shaver is almost elegant.  My husband does not have a bald head so testing was only done on daily beard growth. All 7 blades revolving at once would lead one to hope shaving is quick. But the blades did not give him a close shave and took at least 8 minutes or more to finish.  He had to move the shaver slowly back and forward too many times.  He has another shaver but he was hoping that this 9-in-1 would be his favorite. The nose trimmer attachment and the beard trimmers work okay.  The battery life of this shaver having 90 minutes of shaver time is better than any other shaver he has used, but his Norelco shaver gives a super close shave in about 5 minutes.  I am giving this item 3 stars but not recommending it, although it may do a better job on shaving a bald head.",[],B09FKT5PQ9,B09FKT5PQ9,AHHQMVOQSY4WOIU5AWA5AEAQPJ6Q,2022-01-16 06:06:39.275,0,False,4339,"('NEGATIVE', 0.637941300868988)",NEGATIVE,0.637941300868988

The bottom of the humidor has felt adhered to protect the box as well as the surface where it will be kept.  The lid opens and closes easily, and when you open it all the way it will stay open until you shut it.  This humidor is strong and durable and weighs 3 lb,+ 7.7 oz.  The provided divider stays in place with a tight fit.<br /><br />Overall, this is a well-constructed, elegant, and functional cigar humidor at a reasonable price.

The bottle dropper works good and no leaks in cap rim as I shake it every time before using.  Still, I think it is critical to get enough B12 especially for us older folks.

5,Amazing Healing Properties!,I purchased this oil to enhance borage oil cream and I can’t say enough great things about it!  It has healed my dry cracked nails and made my skin feel so hydrated.  My husband is now using it as well.  He has diabetes so his skin heals very slowly.

5,Worked for Us - Toto CST743 Drake Round,"My wife has major knee issues.  I purchased this and installed per instructions.  If you're a handy man type, this will pose no problem for the installation.  The white color matched the white porcelain of the toilet.  The base of the Toto Drake is longer than Toilevator's 22.3 inch length and extends off the platform 1 inch in the back.  It doesn't effect stability.  I know it can hold just over 300 lbs. without structural failure, in the 2 months we have had it.<br /><br />I purchased the item because there were no ADA or otherwise round toilets available 3.5"" taller than the Drake and this Toto has been great operationally and for longevity of parts.  With the Toilevator's 3.5"" lift, I kept my original toilet, and my wife's knees are much easier to extend when she stands up.  I was rather concerned about the weight, but it said 500 lbs. was the limit.  It has proved sound.  It has been easy to clean.  The toilet hasn't shifted or slid on the base.  The bolts extended higher than the top of the Toto toilet base.  I just purchased a deep cap rather than cut them.  All needed items are in the kit, except for the deeper bolt cap covers.  I also needed a new bowl gasket (seals the tank to the bowl) as I took off the tank to make handling much easier for me.<br /><br />****<br />The only issue for me were the closet bolts that were supplied (These connect the toilet base and the Toilevator to the sewer flange at the floor).  The heads of the bolts were round, not flat, and appeared to be galvanized.  They should be stainless steel.  They would not fit under the flange.  I simply ground the head and sides down a bit till they fit, and applied plumbers grease to the threads to prevent the bolt and nut becoming rusted together.  Years of experience have taught me to think ahead.......",[],B07XKVLVCP,B07XKVLVCP,AH42YH4DUDUK6KYZWS7GDRARI2BQ,2021-06-25 21:38:25.142,4,True,4632,"('NEGATIVE', 0.9951920509338379)",NEGATIVE,0.9951920509338379

Over the past several years I have been discovering the value of silver as a disinfectant, antimicrobial and antiviral remedy.  First, I found nano silver in a liquid form that it ingested internally.  That was 4 years ago and I haven't been sick since my first dose.  My latest discovery is silver ointment and gels for the skin.  WOW!<br /><br />Now, I have been using the Silver Shield Gel for external applications and it is every bit as effective for cuts, blisters, blemishes, acne, boils and all other problems the present on the skin.  I dab a little bit of this on any kind of eruption and it is usually gone within 24 hours.

1,The Lids Will Not Stay On.  Very Disappointing!,"This make up brush is so dissappointing. Good quality makeup brushes are not hard to find, but the kind that retract seem to be few and far between. I was so glad to find this little brush, because I travel a lot and have trouble keeping my make up brushes clean.<br /><br />As soon as I opened the package, the lids fell off! They are so loose that it is no use even trying to use these brushes for their intended purpose. I tried crimping the lids a little so they would grip, but it was no use. They simply do NOT fit well, won't stay on and that is all there is to it. This is not a fluke, because I also ordered the retractable blush brush (made by the same company), and it has the same problem.<br /><br />The actual brushes are not my favorite, and this little eye shadow brush has made it's way to the bottom of my make up drawer, to languish for a respectable amount of time till I decide to face that I will never use this.  Even if I liked the brush, no matter how good the brushes are, if the lids don't stay on the whole purpose of a retractable brush is defeated.<br /><br />Another weird thing is that the seller was supposed to be a company called BOOKS FROM BOULDER.

5,LOVE this stuff!!,"This is the only form of iodine that I can take.  Not only that years ago I was treated for Lyme disease.  My heavy metals were tested and my Lead and Mercury were off the chart.  While at an amazing clinic I was also treated with chelation therapy to reduce my heavy metals.  By the time I left my Lead and Mercury were about 1/2 of what they had been, but were still way too high.  I came home bought an IV pkg from a local Dr. but they made me wait 4 months before I could start chelation therapy again.  During that time I was taking 5-7 of these a day to help with my energy.  I had read that this can remove heavy metals, but??? how effectively.  When the Dr. finally had time to see me 4 months later and they tested me for Heavy metals they were all but gone!!!  This stuff had pulled the rest of them out of my system.  The $1,000 I paid just had to be used for the occasional Vitamin C IV, because no one ever refunds money.  Now, the thing about heavy metals is that they can get into every cell so you clean out the blood and other stores will be released.  Meaning it might take years and years to completely remove all of the heavy metals depending upon how long you had mercury in your mouth, how much, or how long you were exposed to other things. If you are using it for anything other than as an iodine source you might want to have your Heavy Metals tested to check your progress.

I got the Junp Wild Berry just as SoCal got its first heat wave, and it really did the trick.  After the rides I didn't find myself lunging for a can of coconut water like I was expecting, and later in the day I didn't have the slightly jittery feeling due to depletion of electrolytes and salts.  No shade on the other products I’ve tried, but I usually find myself needing a little 'boost' after rides when using them.<br /><br />A surprising bonus point was that the Junp didn't seem to clog my water bottle valves like some of the other hydration mixes I've used.
